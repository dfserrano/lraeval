        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLTs) plays an important role in airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma. Measurement of urinary leukotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) is a sensitive and noninvasive method of assaying total body CysLTs level. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of urinary leukotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) in childhood asthma. METHODS: Sixty children with acute asthma were randomly divided into montelukast (leukotriene receptor antagonist) treatment and conventional treatment groups (n = 30 each). Urinary LTE(4) levels were measured using ELISA and the airway resistance Rint was assessed by the lung function instrument at the acute and the convalescence phases. Twenty healthy children were used as the control group. RESULTS: Urinary LTE(4) levels in asthmatic children at the acute and the convalescence phases were significantly higher than those in the control group (p<0.01). The urinary LTE(4) levels at the convalescence phase were significantly reduced compared with those at the acute phase in asthmatic children (p<0.01). More significantly decreased urinary LTE(4) levels were noted in the montelukast treatment group than the conventional treatment group at the convalescence phase (p<0.01). In the acute phase, there was no correlation between urinary LTE4 level and Rint in asthmatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary LTE(4) level is significantly increased in children with acute asthma. Urinary LTE(4) is a useful marker for the diagnosis of asthma and can be as a predictor of asthma control and marker of susceptibility to treatment with leukotriene receptor antagonists.",

        "abstract": "Statins have been proposed as a novel treatment of respiratory diseases including asthma. Although the mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of statins is still unclear, an inhibition of protein prenylation by depleting the downstream metabolites of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase might be involved. To test the hypothesis, the effects of GGTI-2133, a direct inhibitor of geran ylgeranyltransferase (GGTase), on antigen-induced airway inflammation were investigated in a murine model of allergic bronchial asthma. Mice were sensitized and repeatedly challenged with ovalbumin antigen (OA). Animals were also treated with GGTI-2133 (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) once a day before and during the antigen inhalation period. Repeated antigen inhalation caused an infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, into airways. Significant increases in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, eotaxin, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and total and OA-specific IgE in sera were also found in the antigen-exposed animals. The systemic treatments with GGTI-2133 inhibited the antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration into airways almost completely. However, interestingly, the GGTI-2133 treatment did not affect the levels of these chemotactic factors and IgE. These findings suggest that selective inhibition of GGTase is effective for eosinophilic airway inflammation such as asthma.",
