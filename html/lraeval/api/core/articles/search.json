      "fullText": "1Relativity1\nMichel Janssen\nThe first thing to note about the theory of relativity is that there are two different theories\nof relativity, the special theory put forward in Albert Einstein’s famous 1905 paper, “On\nthe Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” and the general theory, completed in November\n1915 and first presented systematically in a review article published in March 1916.\nSpecial relativity extends the principle of relativity for uniform motion, known in\nmechanics since the days of Galileo, to all of physics, in particular to electrodynamics,\nthe field out of which the theory grew. Although the key contribution was Einstein’s,\nseveral other scientists deserve credit for it as well, most importantly the Dutch physicist\nH. A. Lorentz, the French mathematician Henri Poincaré, and the German mathematician\nHermann Minkowski. General relativity, by contrast, was essentially the work of one\nman. It was the crowning achievement of Einstein’s scientific career. Its name, however,\nis something of a misnomer. The theory does not extend the principle of relativity for\nuniform motion to non-uniform motion. It retains the notion of absolute\nacceleration—i.e., acceleration with respect to space-time rather than with respect to\nother bodies. In this sense, general relativity is no different from Newtonian theory or\nspecial relativity. Absolute acceleration, however, is much more palatable in general\nrelativity than in these earlier theories.\nFrom the point of view of modern physics, the question to what extent general\nrelativity fulfilled Einstein’s original hopes of relativizing all motion is of secondary\nimportance. What matters most is that general relativity is a powerful new theory of\ngravity, based on the insight, called the equivalence principle, that the effects of gravity\nand those of acceleration ought to be described by one and the same structure, curved\nspace-time.\n                                                 \n1\n To appear in: Maryanne Cline Horowitz et al., eds. Dictionary of the History of Ideas. New York: Charles\nScribner's Sons. In preparation.\n2Special Relativity\nSpecial relativity grew out of problems in electrodynamics. In 1862 James Clerk\nMaxwell first published the set of equations named after him, providing a comprehensive\ndescription of all electric and magnetic phenomena that had been studied up to that point.\nHe also made a new prediction. The equations allow electromagnetic waves propagating\nat the speed of light. Maxwell famously concluded: “light consists of the transverse\nundulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena”\n(Niven, I, 500).\nAs the quotation above illustrates, it was taken for granted in the 19th century that\nboth light waves and electric and magnetic fields need a medium to support them. This\nmedium, which was thought to fill the entire universe, was called the luminiferous (=\nlight carrying) ether. Most physicists believed that it was completely immobile (for\ndiscussion of the reasons for this belief, see Janssen and Stachel). Ordinary matter, they\nthought, would move through the ether without disturbing it in the least. The earth, for\ninstance, would zip through the ether at a velocity in the order of 30 km/s, the velocity of\nthe earth’s motion around the sun. On earth there should therefore be a brisk ether wind\nblowing in the opposite direction. This ether drift, as it was called, could not be felt\ndirectly, but ever since the resurgence of the wave theory of light at the beginning of the\n19th century, attempts had been made to detect its influence on light from terrestrial and\ncelestial sources. To be sure, such effects were expected to be small. The velocity of\nlight, after all, is ten thousand times greater than the earth’s velocity in its orbit around\nthe sun. Yet optical experiments were accurate enough to detect such effects. All attempts\nto detect the elusive ether drift, however, failed, and optical theory had to be adjusted to\naccount for these failures.\nThe combination of Maxwell’s theory and the concept of an immobile ether likewise\nfaced the problem of how to explain the absence of any detectable ether drift. When\nMaxwell found that his equations predict electromagnetic waves propagating with the\nvelocity of light, he quite naturally assumed that this would be their velocity with respect\nto the ether. As long as one accepts classical kinematics, as everyone before Einstein\ntacitly did, it trivially follows that their velocity with respect to an observer on earth is\n3the vector sum of the velocity of propagation in the ether and the velocity of the ether\ndrift on earth. This, in turn, meant that Maxwell’s equations could only hold in a frame of\nreference at rest in the ether: in a moving frame, electromagnetic waves would have\ndifferent velocities in different directions. The frame of reference of the earth is such a\nmoving frame. We are thus driven to the conclusion that Maxwell’s equations do not hold\nin the frame in and for which they were discovered! Experiments with electricity and\nmagnetism were not accurate enough to detect any possible deviations from Maxwell’s\nequations, but experiments in optics were. The failure of such experiments to detect ether\ndrift thus posed a problem for the theory.\nIn the 1890s Lorentz set out to explain the absence of any signs of ether drift on the\nbasis of Maxwell’s theory. Using classical kinematics, Lorentz first determined the laws\nthat electric and magnetic fields obey in a frame moving through the ether given that they\nobey Maxwell’s equations in a frame at rest in the ether. He then replaced the\ncomponents ( Ex , …, Bx , …) of the real electric and magnetic fields E and B by the\ncomponents ( ′Ex , …, ′Bx , …) of the auxiliary and, as far as Lorentz was concerned,\npurely fictitious fields ′E  and ′B . The components of these auxiliary fields mix\ncomponents of the real electric and magnetic fields (e.g., in a frame moving with velocity\nv in the x-direction, ′ ≈ −E E vBy y z ). He did the same with the space and time coordinates.\nIn particular, he replaced the real time t by a fictitious variable ′t , which he gave the\nsuggestive name ‘local time’ because it depends on position (in a frame moving with\nvelocity v in the x-direction, ′ ≈ −t t v c x( / )2 ). Lorentz chose these quantities in such a\nway that in any frame moving through the ether with some constant velocity v, the\nfictitious fields ′E  and ′B  as functions of the fictitious variables ′ ′( )x ,t  satisfy\nMaxwell’s equations, just as the real fields as functions of the real space and time\nvariables in a frame at rest in the ether. Maxwell’s equations, in other words, are invariant\nunder the transformation from the real fields E and B as functions of the space and time\ncoordinates in a frame at rest in the ether to the fictitious fields ′E  and ′B  as functions of\nthe fictitious space and time coordinates of a moving frame. This is the essence of what\nLorentz called the theorem of corresponding states (Janssen 2002, 424). The\n4transformation is an example of what are now called Lorentz transformations. Maxwell’s\nequations are invariant under Lorentz transformations— or Lorentz invariant for short.\nWith the help of this mathematical result, Lorentz was able to show in 1895 that, to\nfirst order in the small quantity v c/ ≈ −10 4, many phenomena on earth or in any other\nframe moving through the ether will be indistinguishable from the corresponding\nphenomena in a frame at rest in the ether. In particular, he could show that, at least to this\ndegree of accuracy, motion through the ether would not affect the pattern of light and\nshadow obtained in any optical experiment. Since the vast majority of optical\nexperiments eventually boil down to the observation of such patterns, this was a very\npowerful result.\nIn 1899—and more systematically in 1904 (Einstein et al., 1954, 9–34)—Lorentz\nextended his analysis to higher powers of v c/ . He now found that there is a tiny\ndifference between the pattern of light and shadow obtained in an experiment performed\nwhile moving through the ether and the pattern of light and shadow obtained in the\ncorresponding experiment performed at rest in the ether. Compared to the latter, the\nformer pattern is contracted by a factor 1 2 2− v c/  in the direction of motion. Lorentz\nhad come across this contraction factor before. In 1887, the American scientists Albert A.\nMichelson and Edward W. Morley had tried to detect ether drift in an experiment\naccurate to order v c/( )2 . They had not found any. Independently of one another (in 1889\nand 1892, respectively), the Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald and Lorentz had\nsuggested that this negative result could be accounted for by assuming that material\nbodies, such as the optical components in the experiment, contract by a factor\n1 2 2− v c/  in the direction of motion. Lorentz’s analysis of 1899 and 1904 showed that\nthis contraction hypothesis, as it came to be known, could be used not just to explain why\nthe Michelson-Morley experiment had not detected any ether drift but to explain much\nmore generally why no observation of patterns of light and shadow ever would.\nIn modern terms, the hypothesis that Lorentz added to his theory in 1899 is that the\nlaws governing matter, like Maxwell’s equations, are Lorentz invariant. To this end,\nLorentz had to amend the Newtonian laws that had jurisdiction over matter in his theory.\nAs he had shown in the case of Maxwell’s equations, it is a direct consequence of the\n5Lorentz invariance of the laws governing a physical system that the system will undergo\nthe Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction when moving with respect to the ether. From a purely\nmathematical point of view, Lorentz had thereby arrived at special relativity. To meet the\ndemands of special relativity, all that needs to be done is to make sure that any proposed\nphysical law is Lorentz invariant. Conceptually, however, Lorentz’s theory is very\ndifferent from Einstein’s. In Einstein’s theory, the Lorentz invariance of all physical laws\nreflects a new space-time structure. Lorentz retained Newton’s conception of space and\ntime, the structure of which is reflected in the invariance of the laws of Newtonian\nphysics under what are now called Galilean transformations. It is an unexplained\ncoincidence in Lorentz’s theory that all laws are invariant under Lorentz transformations,\nwhich have nothing to do with the Newtonian space-time structure posited by the theory.\nThis mismatch between the Newtonian concepts of space and time (and the classical\nGalilean kinematics associated with it) and the Lorentz invariance of the laws governing\nmatter and fields in space-time manifests itself in many other ways. Einstein hit upon a\nparticular telling example of this kind and used it in the very first paragraph of his 1905\npaper. The example is illustrated in Figure 1.\nmagnet\nmagnet moving conductor moving\nwire\n(a) (b)\nv v\nFig. 1. Einstein’s magnet-conductor experiment.\nConsider a bar magnet and a conductor—a piece of wire hooked up to an\nammeter—moving with respect to one another at relative velocity v. In Lorentz’s theory\nwe need to distinguish two cases, (a) with the conductor and (b) with the magnet at rest in\nthe ether. In case (a) the approaching magnet causes the magnetic field at the location of\nthe wire to grow. According to Faraday’s law of induction, this change in magnetic field\n6induces an electric field, producing a current in the wire, which is registered by the\nammeter. In case (b) the magnetic field is not changing and there is no induced electric\nfield. The ammeter, however, still registers a current. This is because the electrons in the\nwire are moving in the magnetic field and experience a Lorentz force that makes them go\naround the wire. It turns out that the currents in cases (a) and (b) are exactly the same.\nYet, Lorentz’s theoretical account of what produces these currents is very different for\nthe two cases. We have here, in Einstein’s words, an example of theoretical “asymmetries\nthat do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena” (Einstein et al., 1954, 37). Einstein\nproposed to remove the asymmetry by insisting that cases (a) and (b) are just one and the\nsame situation looked at from different perspectives. Even though this meant that he had\nto jettison the ether, Einstein took the relativity principle for uniform motion from\nmechanics and applied it to this situation in electrodynamics. He then proposed to extend\nthe principle to all of physics.\nIn 1919, in an article intended for Nature but never actually submitted, Einstein\nexplained the importance of the example of the magnet and the conductor for the genesis\nof special relativity: “The idea that we would be dealing here with two fundamentally\ndifferent situations was unbearable to me […] The existence of the electric field was\ntherefore a relative one, dependent on the coordinate system used, and only the electric\nand magnetic field taken together could be ascribed some kind of objective reality. This\nphenomenon of electromagnetic induction forced me to postulate the […] relativity\nprinciple” (Stachel et al., Vol. 7, 264–265; Janssen 2002, 504). The lack of documentary\nevidence for the period leading up to his creative outburst in his miracle year 1905 makes\nit very hard to reconstruct Einstein’s path to special relativity (for a valiant attempt see\nRynasiewicz). It seems clear, however, that Einstein hit upon the idea of ‘the relativity of\nelectric and magnetic fields’ expressed in the quotation above before he hit upon the new\nideas about space and time for which special relativity is most famous. His reading of\nworks of Lorentz and Poincaré probably helped him connect the dots from one to the\nother.\nOnce again consider the example of the magnet and the conductor in Fig. 1. From the\npoint of view of the magnet (b), the electromagnetic field only has a magnetic\ncomponent. From the point of view of the conductor (a), this same field has both a\n7magnetic and an electric component. Lorentz’s work provides the mathematics needed to\ndescribe this state of affairs. Einstein came to recognize that the fictitious fields of\nLorentz’s theorem of corresponding states are in fact the fields measured by a moving\nobserver. (He also recognized that the roles of Lorentz’s two observers, one at rest and\none moving in the ether, are completely interchangeable.) If the observer at rest with\nrespect to the magnet measures a magnetic field with z-component Bz , then the observer\nat rest with respect to the conductor will not only measure a magnetic field but also an\nelectric field with y-component ′Ey. This is captured in Lorentz’s formula ′ ≈ −E E vBy y z\nfor one of the components of his fictitious fields.\nMaxwell’s theory is compatible with the relativity principle if it can be shown that the\nobserver measuring the Lorentz-transformed electric and magnetic fields ′E  and ′B  also\nmeasures the Lorentz-transformed space and time coordinates ′ ′( )x ,t . Carefully\nanalyzing how an observer moving through the ether would synchronize her clocks,\nPoincaré had already shown to first order in v c/  that such clocks register Lorentz’s local\ntime (Janssen, 428). A direct consequence of this is that observers in relative motion to\none another will disagree about whether two events occurring in different places\nhappened simultaneously or not. Distant simultaneity is not absolute but depends upon\nthe state of motion of the observer making the call. This insight made everything fall into\nplace for Einstein about six weeks before he published his famous 1905 paper.\nEinstein modeled the presentation of his theory on thermodynamics (as he explained,\nfor instance, in an article for The London Times in 1919; see Einstein 1954, 228). He\nstarted from two postulates, the analogues of the two laws of thermodynamics. The first\nis the relativity postulate, which extends the principle of the relativity of uniform motion\nfrom mechanics to all of physics; the other, known as the light postulate, is the key\nprediction that Einstein needed from electrodynamics to develop his theory: “light is\nalways propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the\nstate of motion of the emitting body” (Einstein et al., 1954, 37). The combination of these\ntwo postulates appears to lead to a contradiction: two observers in relative motion will\nboth claim that one and the same light beam has velocity c with respect to them! Einstein\nreassured the reader that the two postulates are “only apparently irreconcilable” (ibid.).\nReconciling the two, however, requires giving up several common-sense notions about\n8space and time and replacing them with unfamiliar new ones, such as the relativity of\nsimultaneity, length contraction (moving objects are shorter than identical objects at rest),\nand time dilation (processes in moving systems take longer than identical processes in\nsystems at rest). Einstein derived these effects from his two postulates and the plausible\nassumption that space and time are still homogeneous and isotropic in his new theory.\nFollowing Poincaré’s lead but without neglecting terms smaller than of order v c/ ,\nEinstein showed that the time and space coordinates of two observers in uniform relative\nmotion are related to one another through a Lorentz transformation. Einstein thus\nintroduced a new kinematics. In the second part of his paper, he showed that this new\nkinematics removes the incompatibility of Maxwell’s equations with the relativity\nprinciple. He did this simply by proving that Maxwell’s equations are Lorentz invariant.\nSince he was familiar with an early version of Lorentz’s theorem of corresponding states\n(valid to order v c/ ), he would have had no trouble with this proof.\nIn 1908, Minkowski supplied the geometry of the space-time to which Einstein’s new\nkinematics applies. The geometry of this Minkowski space-time is similar to Euclidean\ngeometry. Frames of reference in different states of motion resemble Cartesian coordinate\nsystems with different orientations of their axes. Lorentz transformations in Minkowski\nspace-time are akin to rotations in Euclidean space. The demand that physical laws be\nLorentz invariant thus acquired the same status as the demand that physical laws should\nbe independent of the orientation of the axes of the coordinate system used to formulate\nthem.\nIn a passage that echoes Einstein’s comments about electric and magnetic fields\nquoted above, Minkowski wrote: “space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade\naway into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an\nindependent reality” (Einstein et al., 1954, 73). Different observers in Minkowski space-\ntime will agree on the space-time distance between any two events, but disagree on how\nto break down that spatio-temporal distance into a spatial and a temporal component. It is\nthis disagreement that lies behind relativity of simultaneity, length contraction, and time\ndilation, the effects Einstein had derived from his two postulates (Janssen 2002,\n429–430). In light of this analysis, Minkowski pointed out, the phrase ‘relativity\npostulate’ seemed ill-chosen: “Since the postulate comes to mean that only the four-\n9dimensional world in space and time is given […] but that the projection in space and in\ntime may still be undertaken with a certain degree of freedom, I prefer to call it the\npostulate of the absolute world” (Einstein et al., 1954, 83).\nEinstein agreed with Minkowski on this point but felt that it was already too late to\nchange the theory’s name. Minkowski’s geometrical reformulation of the theory,\nhowever, initially met with resistance on Einstein’s part, who dismissed it as “superfluous\nlearnedness” (Pais, 152). He only came to value Minkowski’s contribution in his work on\ngeneral relativity.\nGeneral Relativity\nEinstein was not satisfied with special relativity for very long. He felt strongly that the\nprinciple of relativity for uniform motion ought to be generalized to arbitrary motion. In\nhis popular book on relativity of 1917 (Einstein 1961, 72, ch. 21), he used a charming\nanalogy to explain what he found so objectionable about absolute motion. Consider two\nidentical tea kettles sitting on a stove. One is giving off steam, but the other is not. You\nare puzzled by this until you see that the burner under the first kettle is turned on, but that\nthe burner under the second is not. Compare this situation to that of two identical globes\nrotating with respect to one another around the line connecting their centers (Einstein et\nal., 112–115, sec. 2). This situation, like that of the two tea kettles, at first seems to be\ncompletely symmetric. Observers on both globes will see the other globe rotating. Yet\none globe bulges out at the equator, while the other does not. What is responsible for this\ndifference? The Newtonian answer is: absolute space. What makes a globe bulge out is\nnot its rotation with respect to the other globe, but its rotation with respect to absolute\nspace. The special-relativistic answer is the same except that Newton’s absolute space\nneeds to be replaced by Minkowski’s absolute space-time. Einstein found this answer\nunsatisfactory, because neither Newton’s absolute space nor Minkowski’s absolute space-\ntime can be directly observed. And without an observable cause for the difference\nbetween the two globes, we would have a violation of Leibniz’s Principle of Sufficient\nReason. It would be as if the burners under both tea kettles were turned on, but only one\nof them gave off steam.\n10\nThere is a crucial difference, however, between the Newtonian and the special-\nrelativistic answer (Dorling). In special relativity, the situation of the two globes is not\neven symmetric at the kinematical level. Because of time dilation, one revolution of the\nother globe takes less time for an observer on the globe rotating in Minkowski space-time\nthan it does for an observer on the other one. It therefore need not surprise us that the\nsituation is not symmetric at the dynamical level either, i.e., that only one globe bulges\nout. In terms of Einstein’s analogy: if the two tea kettles do not look the same, it need not\nsurprise us that they do not behave the same. Absolute acceleration in special relativity\nthus does not violate the Principle of Sufficient Reason. Einstein failed to appreciate that\nspecial relativity had already solved what he himself identified as the problem of absolute\nmotion.\nEinstein set out on the road that would lead to general relativity in 1907. In the 1919\narticle quoted in the preceding section, he vividly recalls the initial flash of insight.\nImmediately following the passage quoted earlier, he writes: “Then came to me the best\nidea [die glücklichste Gedanke] of my life […] Like the electric field generated by\nelectromagnetic induction, the gravitational field only has a relative existence. Because,\nfor an observer freely falling from the roof of a house, no gravitational field exists while\nhe is falling. The experimental fact that the acceleration due to gravity does not depend\non the material is thus a powerful argument for extending the relativity postulate to\nsystems in non-uniform relative motion” (Pais, 178; Janssen 2002, 507).\nThis extended relativity postulate, it turns out, is highly problematic. What it boils\ndown to is that two observers accelerating with respect to one another can both claim to\nbe at rest if they agree to disagree about whether a gravitational field is present or not.\nThis curious principle is best illustrated with a couple of examples.\nFirst, consider the unfortunate observer falling from the roof in Einstein’s example.\nFor a fleeting moment this person will feel like a modern astronaut orbiting the earth in a\nspace-shuttle. Einstein, watching his observer accelerate downwards from the safety of\nhis room in the Berne Patent Office where he was working at the time, is at rest in the\ngravitational field of the earth. For the falling person, however, there seems to be no\ngravitational field. He can, if he wishes, maintain that he is at rest and that Einstein and\nthe Patent Office are accelerating upwards.\n11\nAs a second example, imagine two astronauts in rocket ships hovering side-by-side in\nsomewhere in outer space where the effects of gravity are negligible. One of the\nastronauts fires up the engines of her rocket ship. According to the other astronaut she\naccelerates, but she can, if she were so inclined, maintain that she is at rest in the\ngravitational field that suddenly came into being when her engines were switched on and\nthat the other rocket ship and its crew are in free fall in this gravitational field. Einstein\nproduced an account of the twin paradox along these lines as late as 1919 (Stachel et al.,\nVol. 7, Doc. 13).\nNotice that the ‘relativity of acceleration’ in these two examples is very different\nfrom the relativity of uniform motion in special relativity. Two observers in uniform\nrelative motion are physically fully equivalent to one another; two observers in non-\nuniform relative motion are not. This is clear in both examples. (1) Free fall in a\ngravitational field (a) feels different from resisting the pull of gravity (b). (2) Hovering in\nouter space (a) feels different from accelerating in outer space (b). In both cases, the\n‘relativity of acceleration’ is relativity in name only. In fact, the pair (1a)–(2a) and the\npair (1b)–(2b) feel the same.\nEinstein’s excitement about “the best idea of his life” was nonetheless fully justified.\nGalileo’s principle that all matter falls with the same acceleration in a given gravitational\nfield cries out for an explanation. Newton incorporated the principle by giving two very\ndifferent concepts of mass the same numerical value. He set inertial mass, a measure of a\nbody’s resistance to acceleration, equal to gravitational mass, a measure of a body’s\nsusceptibility to gravity. In Newton’s theory this is an unexplained coincidence. Einstein\ncorrectly surmised that this equality points to an intimate connection between\nacceleration and gravity. He called this connection the equivalence principle. It was not\nuntil after he finished his general theory of relativity, however, that he was able to\narticulate what exactly the connection is.\nThat did not stop him from relying heavily on the equivalence principle in\nconstructing his theory. Since accelerating in Minkowski space-time feels the same as\nresisting the pull of gravity, Einstein was able to glean some features of gravitational\nfields in general by studying acceleration in Minkowski space-time. In particular, he\nexamined the situation of an observer on a rotating disk or a merry-go-round in\n12\nMinkowski space-time. Appealing to the embryonic equivalence principle, the man on\nthe disk can claim to be at rest and attribute the centrifugal forces due to his centripetal\nacceleration to a centrifugal gravitational field. Suppose the man on the disk and a\nwoman standing next to it are both asked to determine the ratio of the disk’s\ncircumference to its radius. The woman will find 2π, the answer given by Euclidean\ngeometry. Because of length contraction, which affects the measuring rods placed along\nthe circumference but not the ones along the radius which move perpendicularly to their\nlength, the man on the disk will find a value greater than 2π. This means that the spatial\ngeometry for an observer rotating in Minkowski space-time is non-Euclidean. The\nequivalence principle says that the spatial geometry for an observer in a gravitational\nfield will then, in general, also be non-Euclidean. This simple consideration, in all\nlikelihood, gave Einstein the idea to represent gravity by the curvature of space-time\n(Howard and Stachel, 48–62).\nRecognizing that gravity is part of the fabric of space-time made it possible to give a\nmore precise formulation of the equivalence principle. The mature form of the\nequivalence principle is brought out very nicely by the analogy that Einstein sets up but\nnever quite finishes in the 1919 passage quoted above. Special relativity made it clear\nthat electric and magnetic fields are part of one entity, the electromagnetic field, which\nbreaks down differently into electric and magnetic components for different observers.\nGeneral relativity similarly made it clear that the inertial structure of space-time and the\ngravitational field are not two separate entities but components of one entity, now called\nthe inertio-gravitational field. Inertial structure determines the trajectories of free\nparticles. Gravity makes all particles deviate from these trajectories in identical fashion,\nregardless of their mass. These are the only marching orders that all particles have to\nobey. In general relativity, they are all issued by one and the same authority, the inertio-\ngravitational field, represented by curved space-time. Which marching orders are credited\nto inertial structure and which ones to gravity depends on the state of motion of the\nobserver. The connection between acceleration (or, equivalently, inertia) and gravity is\nthus one of unification rather than one of reduction, as with the nominal ‘relativity of\nacceleration’ discussed above in which acceleration was being reduced to gravity.\n13\nHow do the examples of non-uniform motion discussed above fit into the new scheme\nof things? Free fall in a gravitational field (1a) and hovering in outer space (2a) are both\nrepresented as motion along the straightest possible lines in what in general will be a\ncurved space-time. Such lines are called geodesics. Resisting the pull of gravity (1b) and\naccelerating in outer space (2b) are both represented as motion along crooked lines or\nnon-geodesics. Since no change of perspective will transform a geodesic into a non-\ngeodesic or vice versa, there is an absolute difference between (1a) and (1b) as well as\nbetween (2a) and (2b). Absolute acceleration survives in general relativity, as in special\nrelativity, in the guise of an absolute distinction between geodesic and non-geodesic\nmotion. This does not violate the Principle of Sufficient Reason since geodesics and non-\ngeodesics are already different at a purely kinematical or geometrical level.\nEinstein did not give up his crusade against absolute motion so easily. Once he had\nrealized that gravity is space-time curvature, he quickly came up with a new (though once\nagain flawed) strategy for extending the principle of relativity from uniform to arbitrary\nmotion. To describe curved space-time, Einstein had turned to the theory of curved\nsurfaces of the great 19th-century German mathematician Carl-Friedrich Gauss. To\ndescribe such surfaces (think of the surface of the earth for instance) one needs a map, a\ngrid that assigns unique coordinates to every point of the surface, and sets of numbers to\nconvert coordinate distances (i.e., distances on a map) to real distances (i.e., distance on\nthe actual surface). These sets of numbers are called the components of the metric tensor.\nIn general they are different for different points. The conversion from coordinate\ndistances to real distances is thus given by a field, called the metric field, which assigns\nthe appropriate metric tensor to every point.\nA simple example may help to better understand the concept of a metric tensor field.\nOn a standard map of the earth, countries close to the equator look smaller than countries\nclose to the poles. The conversion factors from coordinate distances to real distances are\ntherefore larger near the equator than they are near the poles. The metric tensor field thus\nvaries from point to point, just like an electromagnetic field. Furthermore, at one and the\nsame point, the conversion factor for north-south distances may differ from the\nconversion factor for east-west distances. The metric tensor at one point thus has different\ncomponents for different directions.\n14\nGauss’ theory of curved surfaces was generalized to spaces of higher dimension by\nanother German mathematician, Bernhard Riemann. This Riemannian geometry can\nhandle curved space-time as well. In the case of four-dimensional space(-time), the\nmetric tensor has ten independent components. In Einstein’s theory, the metric tensor\nfield does double duty: it describes both the geometry of space-time and the gravitational\nfield. Mass—or its equivalent, energy—is the source of gravitational fields. Which field\nis produced by a given source is determined by so-called field equations. To complete his\ntheory Einstein thus had to find field equations for the metric field.\nEinstein hoped to find field equations that would retain their form under arbitrary\ncoordinate transformations. This property is called general covariance. The description\nof curved space-time outlined in the preceding paragraph clearly is generally covariant.\nOne can choose any grid to assign coordinates to the points of space-time. Each choice\nwill come with its own sets of conversion factors. In other words, the metric field\nencoding the geometry of the space-time will be represented by different mathematical\nfunctions depending on which coordinates are used. Riemannian geometry is formulated\nin such a way that it works in arbitrary coordinates. It provides standard techniques for\ntransforming the metric field from one coordinate system to another. If only Einstein\ncould find field equations for the metric field that retain their form under arbitrary\ntransformations, his whole theory would be generally covariant. In special relativity,\nLorentz invariance expresses the relativity of uniform motion. Einstein—understandably\nperhaps but mistakenly—thought that extending Lorentz invariance to invariance under\narbitrary transformations would automatically extend the principle of relativity from\nuniform to arbitrary motion.\nThis line of thinking, however, conflates two completely different traditions in 19th-\ncentury geometry (Norton). Minkowski’s work with special relativity is in the tradition of\nprojective geometry, associated with the so-called Erlangen Program of Felix Klein.\nEinstein’s work with general relativity is in the tradition of differential geometry of\nGauss and Riemann. The approaches of Klein and Riemann can be characterized as\n‘subtractive’ and ‘additive’, respectively (Norton).\nIn the subtractive approach one starts from an exhaustive description of space-time\nwith all bells and whistles and then strips down this description to its bare essentials. The\n15\nrecipe for doing that is to assign reality only to elements that are invariant under the\ngroup of transformations that relate different perspectives on the space-time. This group\nof transformations is thus directly related to some relativity principle. The most famous\napplication of this strategy in physics is Minkowski’s geometrical formulation of special\nrelativity. The group of transformations in this case is the group of Lorentz\ntransformations.\nIn the additive approach one starts with the set of space-time points stripped of all\ntheir properties and then adds the minimum geometrical structure needed to define\nstraight(est) lines and distances in space-time. To guarantee that the added structure\ndescribes only intrinsic features of space-time, the demand is made that the description be\ngenerally covariant, i.e., that it does not depend on the coordinates used. This procedure\ncan obviously be applied to any space-time. Only in certain special cases, however, will\nthere be symmetries such as Lorentz invariance in Minkowski space-time reflecting the\nphysical equivalence of different frames of reference and thereby some relativity\nprinciple. In the generic case there will be no symmetries whatsoever  and hence no\nprinciple of relativity at all. This shows that general covariance has nothing to do with\ngeneral relativity. Comparing Lorentz invariance in special relativity and general\ncovariance in general relativity is like comparing apples and oranges.\nIt was not until 1918 that a German high school teacher by the name of Erich\nKretschmann set Einstein straight on this score (Stachel et al., Vol. 7, Doc. 4; Goenner et\nal., 431–462). This was a few years after Einstein had finally found generally-covariant\nfield equations. These equations, first published in November 1915, formed the capstone\nof his general theory of relativity. For more than two years prior to that, Einstein had used\nfield equations that are not generally covariant. He had even found a fallacious but\nultimately profound argument purporting to show that the field equations for the metric\nfield cannot be generally covariant. For reasons that need not concern us here the\nargument is known as the “hole argument” (Howard and Stachel, 63–100; Earman, ch. 9).\nThe problem with generally-covariant field equations, according to the hole argument, is\nthat they allow one and the same source to produce what look like different metric fields,\nwhereas the job of field equations is to determine uniquely what field is produced by a\ngiven source.\n16\nThe escape from the hole argument is that on closer examination the different fields\ncompatible with the same source turn out to be identical. The hole argument rests on the\nassumption that space-time points can be individuated and identified before any of their\nspatio-temporal properties are specified. Reject this assumption and the argument loses\nits force. The allegedly different metric fields only differ in that different featureless\npoints take on the identity of the same space-time points. If space-time points cannot be\nindividuated and identified independently of their spatio-temporal properties, this is no\ndifference at all.\nThis comeback to the hole argument—a popular gloss on Einstein’s so-called “point-\ncoincidence argument” (Goenner et al., 463–500)—amounts to a strong argument against\nthe view that space-time is a substance, a container for the contents of space-time. The\ncomeback shows that there are many ways to map spatio-temporal properties onto\nfeatureless points, all indistinguishable from one another. According to Leibniz’s\nPrinciple of the Identity of Indiscernibles all these indistinguishable ways must be\nphysically identical. But then these points cannot be physically real for that would make\nthe indistinguishable ways of ascribing properties to them physically distinct.\nThe combination of the hole argument and the point coincidence argument is thus\nseen to be a variant of an argument due to Leibniz himself against the Newtonian view\nthat space is a substance (Alexander). If space were a container, one version of the\nargument goes, God could have placed its contents a few feet to the left of where He\nactually placed it. But according to the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles these\ntwo possible universes are identical and that leaves no room for the container, which\ncould serve to distinguish the two. Einstein’s fallacious argument against general\ncovariance thus turned into an argument in support of a Leibnizian relational ontology of\nspace-time.\nDuring the period that Einstein accepted that the field equations of his theory were\nnot generally covariant, he explored yet another strategy for eliminating absolute motion.\nThis strategy was inspired by his reading of Mach’s response to Newton’s famous bucket\nexperiment. Set a bucket filled with water spinning. It will take the water some time to\ncatch up with the rotation of the bucket. Just after the bucket starts rotating, the water will\nstill be at rest and its surface will be flat. Once the water starts rotating, the water will\n17\nclimb up the sides of the bucket and its surface will become concave. Newton pointed out\nthat this effect cannot be due to the relative rotation of the water with respect to the\nbucket. After all, the effect increases as the relative rotation decreases and is at its\nmaximum when there is no relative motion at all because the water is rotating with the\nsame angular velocity as the bucket. Newton concluded that the water surface becomes\nconcave because of the water’s rotation with respect to absolute space. Mach pointed out\nthat there is another possibility: the effect could be due to the relative rotation of the\nwater with respect to all other matter in the universe. Picture the earth, the bucket, and the\nwater at the center of a giant spherical shell representing all other matter in the universe.\nIf Mach were right, it would make no difference whether the bucket or the shell is set\nrotating: in both cases the water surface should become concave. According to Newton’s\ntheory, however, the rotating shell will have no effect whatsoever on the shape of the\nwater surface.\nIn 1913–1914, Einstein was convinced for a while that this was a problem not for\nMach’s analysis but for Newton’s theory and that his own theory vindicated Mach’s\naccount of the bucket experiment. It only takes a cursory look at Einstein’s calculations\nin support of this claim to see that this attempt to relativize rotation is a non-starter. When\nEinstein calculated the metric field of a rotating shell at its center, he considered a shell\nrotating in Minkowski space-time. The rotating shell does produce a tiny deviation from\nthe metric field of Minkowski space-time, but nothing on the order needed to make the\nwater surface concave. What Einstein would have had to show to vindicate Mach is that\nthe metric field produced by the rotating shell near its center mimics Minkowski space-\ntime as seen from a rotating frame of reference. In that case the situation of the bucket at\nrest in this metric field would have been identical to that of the bucket rotating in the\nopposite direction in Minkowski space-time. But in order to calculate the metric field of a\nrotating shell, one needs to make some assumption about boundary conditions, i.e., the\nvalues of the metric field as we go to spatial infinity. Rotation with respect to space-time\nrather than other matter thus creeps back in.\nEinstein’s flawed Machian account of Newton’s bucket experiment receded into the\nbackground when he finally found generally-covariant field equations for the metric field\nin November 1915. As is clear from Einstein’s first systematic exposition of the theory in\n18\n1916 (Einstein et al., 109–164), he still believed at this point that general covariance\nguarantees the relativity of arbitrary motion. The Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter\ndisabused him of this illusion in the fall of 1916 (Stachel et al., Vol. 8, 351–357). De\nSitter pointed out that Einstein used Minkowskian boundary conditions in his calculations\nof metric fields produced by various sources (such as the rotating shell discussed above)\nand thereby retained a remnant of absolute space-time. By early 1917, Einstein had\nworked out his response to De Sitter (Einstein et al., 175–188). He eliminated the need\nfor boundary conditions at infinity simply by eliminating infinity! He proposed a model\nfor the universe that is spatially closed. He chose the simplest model of this kind, which\nis static in addition to being closed. Such a static universe would collapse as a result of\nthe gravitational attraction between its parts. Einstein therefore needed to add a term to\nhis field equations that would provide the gravitational repulsion to neutralize this\nattraction. This term involved what has become known as the cosmological constant. In\nthe late 1920s it became clear that the universe is expanding, in which case the\ngravitational attraction can be allowed to slow down the expansion and does not need to\nbe compensated by a gravitational repulsion. In the wake of these developments, Einstein\nallegedly called the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life. In 1917,\nhowever, he felt he needed it to get rid of boundary conditions.\nDe Sitter quickly produced an alternative cosmological model that was allowed by\nEinstein’s new field equations with cosmological term. In this De Sitter world there is no\nmatter at all. Absolute space-time thus returned with a vengeance. In reaction to De\nSitter’s model, Einstein formulated what would come to be known as Mach’s principle\n(Stachel et al., Vol. 7, Doc. 4): the metric field is fully determined by matter and cannot\nexist without it. Einstein was convinced at this point that the addition of the cosmological\nterm guaranteed that general relativity satisfies this principle, despite the apparent\ncounter-example provided by the De Sitter solution. Early in 1918, Einstein argued that\nthe De Sitter world was not empty after all, but that hidden from view a vast amount of\nmatter was tucked away in it. He concluded that general relativity satisfies Mach’s\nprinciple and that this finally established complete relativity of arbitrary motion. All\nmotion in general relativity is motion with respect to the metric field. But if the metric\nfield can be reduced to matter, talk about such motion can be reinterpreted as a façon de\n19\nparler about motion with respect to the matter generating the metric field. This certainly\nwas a clever idea on Einstein’s part, but by June 1918 it had become clear that the De\nSitter world does not contain any hidden masses and is thus a genuine counter-example to\nMach’s principle. Another one of Einstein’s attempts to relativize all motion had failed.\nEinstein thereupon lost his enthusiasm for Mach’s principle. He accepted that motion\nwith respect to the metric field can not always be translated into motion with respect to\nother matter. He also realized that motion with respect to the metric field or curved space-\ntime is much more palatable than motion with respect to Newton’s absolute space or\nMinkowski’s absolute space-time anyway. The curved space-time of general relativity,\nunlike absolute space(-time), is a bona fide physical entity. It not only acts upon matter,\nlike absolute space(-time), by telling matter how to move, but is also acted upon, as\nmatter tells it how to curve (to borrow two slogans from Misner et al., 5). In his lectures\nin Princeton in May 1921, Einstein reformulated his objection against absolute space(-\ntime) accordingly: it is something that acts but is not acted upon (Einstein 1956, 99–108).\nEinstein had a deeper reason to abandon Mach’s principle. It was predicated on an\nantiquated 19th-century billiard-ball ontology. Einstein thought of matter as consisting of\nelectromagnetic fields, in combination perhaps with gravitational fields (Einstein et al.,\n190–198). Mach’s principle would thus amount to reducing one field to another. As can\nbe inferred from a lecture delivered in Leyden in October 1920 (Einstein 1983, 1–24),\nEinstein came to accept that the metric field exists on a par with the electromagnetic\nfield. Just as he had unified the electric and the magnetic field in special relativity and\nspace-time and gravity in general relativity, he now embarked on the quest for a theory\nunifying the electromagnetic and the inertio-gravitational field. He would spend the rest\nof his life looking for such a theory.\nEinstein’s struggle to relativize all motion, uniform and non-uniform, illustrates the\nold travelers saying that the journey is more important than the destination. Although\nEinstein never reached the destination he originally had in mind, he found many valuable\nresults along the way. For starters, he fulfilled many of his philosophical hopes, albeit in\nways very different from what he originally envisioned. Absolute motion survives in\ngeneral relativity since there is an absolute difference between moving on a geodesics\nand moving on a non-geodesic. But motion with respect to curved space-time with a\n20\ngeometry described by a field interacting with matter (itself described by other fields) is a\nmuch more agreeable proposition than motion with respect to the absolute space(-time) of\nNewtonian theory and special relativity. The combination of the hole argument and the\npoint-coincidence argument, moreover, had provided a strong argument against a\nNewtonian substantival view of space-time and strong support for the rival Leibnizian\nrelational view.\nMore importantly, Einstein had found a new theory of gravity, which does away with\nthe artificial split between space-time and gravity of Newtonian theory. This theory\nopened up such exciting research areas as modern cosmology, black holes, singularities,\ngravitational waves, and gravitational lensing. Even some of the dead ends in Einstein’s\ncrusade against absolute motion led to interesting physics. As these lines are written\nNASA’s Gravity Probe B is trying to detect frame dragging, a phenomenon first\ninvestigated in the context of Einstein’s misguided attempt to vindicate Mach’s account\nof Newton’s bucket experiment. The cosmological constant, originally introduced in the\ncontext of Einstein’s ill-fated attempt to make general relativity satisfy Mach’s principle,\nhas made a spectacular comeback in modern cosmology as a straightforward\nphenomenological description of the repulsion driving the acceleration of the expansion\nof our universe discovered in recent years through Type Ia Supernovae observations.\nEinstein’s quest for general relativity was a very rewarding journey indeed.\nBibliography\nAlexander, H.

The purpose of this formulation is\nto treat GR as a dynamical system. The shift ξi and lapse N are merely auxiliary variables, variation\nwith respect to which yields the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints (2) and (3). GR has 2 true\ndynamical variables per space point. These are what is left of the 6 degrees of freedom of the 3-metric gij,\nonce one has taken the 4 constraints into account. Thus a conﬁguration space for GR, that has a fourfold\nredundancy per space point, is Riem: the space of 3-metrics on a ﬁxed topology (taken here to be compact\nwithout boundary). It is relatively straightforward to understand the restriction placed on this by the\nmomentum constraint, which generates the 3-diﬀeomorphisms: the true dynamical variables are contained\nwithin the 3 degrees of freedom of the 3-geometries and not among the 3 coordinates painted onto these\n3-geometries. Thus GR may be interpreted as a theory of evolving 3-geometries, or geometrodynamics [3].\nThe corresponding conﬁguration space is the quotient space\n{Superspace} =\n{Riem}\n{3-diﬀeomorphisms}\n(4)\nwhich has a single redundancy per space point due to the still-remaining Hamiltonian constraint, H, which\nthen plays a central role in geometrodynamics.\nPossible classical and quantum interpretations of geometrodynamics have been discussed by Wheeler.\nIn particular [3], he asked “If one did not know the Einstein–Hamilton–Jacobi equation, how might one\nhope to derive it straight oﬀ from plausible ﬁrst principles without ever going through the formulation\nof the Einstein ﬁeld equations themselves?”. The ﬁrst stage of answering this question involves ﬁnding\na derivation for H, which is the fully classical analogue of this equation. Following Wheeler’s suggestion\nof presupposing embeddability into a spacetime to answer the question, Hojman, Kuchaˇ r and Teitelboim\n(HKT) [4] obtained the partial answer that the form (3) of H (with an additional optional cosmological\nconstant term) is required in order for the constraints to close as the Dirac Algebra , which is the condition\nto ensure this embeddability. More recently, Barbour, Foster and ´ O Murchadha (BF´ O)’s distinct 3-space\napproach [5] includes doing away with the presupposed embeddability by demanding mere closure, that\nis asking what self-consistent dynamical systems can describe evolving 3-geometries. Their ﬁrst principles\nand method are as follows.\nBF´ O’s ﬁrst principles are 1) to consider prospective laws of physics that are based on relative quantities\nalone, and 2) that there should be no overall notion of time. Principle 1) is to be implemented by working\nwith actions on the appropriate relative conﬁguration space (which is done indirectly, by the method of\n‘best matching’ [6] outlined below). In working with conﬁguration spaces, the whole system is represented\ntherein by a single point, and the evolution of the system is the curve traced out by these points. Because\nthe whole system is represented thus, there is nothing external to the system with respect to which the\nparametrization time-label λ of the curve could be compared. Thus the theory shoukd be invariant under an\noverall reparametrization of the time-label λ. This is what is meant by principle 2) and its implementation\nby working with reparametrization-invariant actions.\nTo treat geometrodynamics, the relative conﬁguration space in question is superspace. In this context,\nbest matching is a method to implement 3-diﬀeomorphism invariance, by correcting the bare velocities of\nall ﬁelds Ψ present according to ˙ Ψ −→ ˙ Ψ − £ξΨ, where the dot is ∂\n∂λ and £ξ denotes the Lie derivative\nwith respect to the vector ﬁeld ξi. This is an indirect implementation since nothing is done to eliminate\nany of the gij and furthermore ξi has been introduced, so that one’s action is on Riem × Ξ, where Ξ is the\n1We use lower-case Latin letters for 3-space indices. Round brackets denote symmetrization of indices, and square brackets\ndenote antisymmetrization. Indices unaﬀected by the (anti)symmetrization are set between vertical lines. gij is the spatial\n3-metric with determinant g and conjugate momentum p\nij. R is the spatial Ricci scalar and spatial covariant derivatives are\ndenoted by a ∇ or a semicolon.space of the ξi. But variation with respect to ξi gives rise to the momentum constraint. If one could solve\nthis for ξi, then one could pass to superspace.\nThe form of the GR action that Baierlein, Sharp and Wheeler (BSW) [7] derived,\nSBSW =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\nd3x\n√\ng\nq\nRTg, (5)\nTg =\n1\n√\ng\nGabcd(˙ gab − £ξgab)(˙ gcd − £ξgcd) (6)\nmay be taken to explicitly show that GR is indeed a theory of this form.\nNow, BF´ O systematically examined such reparametrization-invariant BSW-type actions\nS =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\nd3x\n√\ngL(gij, ˙ gij;ξi) =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\nd3x\n√\ng\np\nPTW, (7)\nwhere the kinetic term\nTW =\n1\n√\ng\nGabcd\nW (˙ gab − £ξgab)(˙ gcd − £ξgcd). (8)\nis built using best matching and the most general ultralocal2 inverse supermetric,\nG\nijkl\nW =\n√\ng(gikgjl − Wgijgkl), which is the inverse of the DeWitt supermetric when the free parameter\nW takes the value 1. BF´ O chose a simple potential term, P = Λ + sR, for Λ constant and without loss\nof generality s ∈ {1,0,−1}; furthermore they showed that some more complicated potentials failed to be\nconsistent.\nBF´ O use Dirac’s generalized Hamiltonian method [8] exhaustively [9], as explained in Sec 2. In outline,\nin addition to the Hi constraint (relation between the momenta) obtained by ξi-variation, a relation HW\nbetween the momenta arises purely from the local square-root form of the Lagrangian in (7). Consistency\nand nontriviality then require HW and Hi to be propagated by the equations of motion without the produc-\ntion of more constraints than the theory has remaining degrees of freedom. The remarkable consequences\nof this exhaustive interpretation include enforcing HW = H(W=1) ≡ H in the Lorentzian (s = 1) case,\nas well as overruling the more complicated potentials, and giving further results on ‘adding on’ general\nbosonic matter, to which we now turn.\nThe reasons for ‘adding on’ matter in answering Wheeler’s question is that its context has changed, for\nhis original hopes that vacuum geometrodynamics could be a uniﬁed theory (by extension of the Rainich–\nMisner–Wheeler ‘already-uniﬁed’ theory of gravity and electromagnetism [10] to include all the other ﬁelds\nof nature), have not been realized. Thus already in 1980 Teitelboim [11] extended HKT’s answer by ‘adding\non’ matter and this is also the way in which BF´ O have treated matter. The BF´ O treatment appears to\ngive some striking derivations of the classical laws of bosonic physics. In particular, rather than being\npresupposed, both gauge theory and the light-cone structure for bosonic theories are enforced, and share\na common origin in the propagation of H. Also in BF´ O’s treatment and its extension by the author and\nBarbour [9], masslessness is enforced on fundamental vector ﬁelds; Maxwell and Yang–Mills theory are\npicked out.\nThe 3-space approach is not just a reformulation of GR. It is also a method by which a limited number of\nother theories of evolving 3-geometries may be constructed, which are very similar to the ADM formulation\nof GR. One such example is conformal gravity [12, 13], which has some promising features as a realistic\nphysical theory.\nAnother example is the theory called strong gravity since it corresponds to the strong-coupled limit of\nGR, in which Newton’s gravitational constant G −→ ∞, or equivalently c −→ 0 [14]. This is the opposite\nof the more common Galilean limit c −→ ∞ (see Fig. 1). In place of the Lorentz group and the light-cone\nstructure, one has an ultralocal ‘Carroll group’ [14] structure in which each point is entirely isolated from\nthe others. Strictly speaking, we must keep Λ/G constant in evaluating this limit from GR. Otherwise the\ntheory is dynamically trivial.\nStrong gravity was ﬁrst considered by Isham [15] as a new regime about which one might construct a\nperturbative theory of quantum gravity, akin to Klauder’s ultralocal ﬁeld theory [16]. In this paper, we\nconsider strong gravity as a dynamically-consistent theory on its own merit. Henneaux [17] showed that\n2By an expression being ultralocal, we mean that it does not contain spatial derivatives.it has an unusual 4-geometry resulting from the degeneracy of the 4-metric; one consequence of this is\nthat, unlike in GR, the constraints and evolution equations do not combine to form a 4-tensor equation.\nMoreover, conformal gravity again does not appear to admit a clean interpretation as a 4-tensor theory.\nSo strong gravity may provide some intuition as to what is possible in such theories.\nStrong gravity approximates GR near the cosmological singularity, making it a worthwhile regime\nto quantize [18]. Strong gravity gives an independent Kasner universe at each spatial point, which is\nthe conjectured behaviour of the general solution of GR. Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz conjectured\nmixmaster behaviour (a sequence of Kasner epochs) at each spatial point [19] whilst straightforward Kasner\nbehaviour at each spatial point can sometimes occur [20]. There is growing numerical evidence for these\nbehaviours [21]. The notion of strong gravity is related to the two most popular approaches to quantum\ngravity as follows. It is analogous to the tensionless string [22], and it admits an Ashtekar variable\nformulation [23, 24] (see Sec 2.3).\nIn Sec 2, we provide a further example: a 1-parameter family of theories of evolving 3-geometries. Their\ndiscovery provides a diﬀerent answer to Wheeler’s question from the uniqueness of BF´ O, in the case of the\nstrong-coupled limit s = 0: there is a consistent theory not only for the W = 1 DeWitt supermetric of the\nusual strong gravity, but also for any ultralocal invertible (W  = 1\n3) supermetric. Whereas in the GR case\nof the 3-space approach the presupposition or otherwise of best matching does not aﬀect the ﬁnal theory\nthat arises by consistency, strong gravity illustrates that this presupposition can alter the ﬁnal theory. The\nspirit of the 3-space approach is to treat our strong gravities as consistent theories of evolving 3-geometries\nin their own right, and hence akin to theories of gravity. Furthermore we discuss how they can be related\n(as limits relevant to the very early universe) to the well-known scalar-tensor theories of gravity (Sec 2.1),\nand used as toy models toward the study of conformal gravity (Sec 2.2).\nGR oﬀers only two regimes amenable to quantization: minisuperspace and strong gravity. This paper\nprovides an enlargement of this second arena, for which diﬀerent ranges of W give rise to considerable\nmathematical diﬀerences [25]. In particular, for W < 1\n3 one has theories with positive-deﬁnite inner\nproducts. The study of these could broaden the understanding of the inner product problem of quantum\ngravity [26]. We furthermore discuss the possibility of the very early universe actually having a positive-\ndeﬁnite inner product. We ﬁnally show (Sec 2.3) that the Ashtekar variable formulation, of potentially\ngreat use in quantization, is not readily available for W  = 1.\nIn Secs 3.1 and 3.2, we couple to strong gravity scalar ﬁelds and many interacting vector ﬁelds respec-\ntively. This enables fruitful comparison with matter coupling in the GR case (Secs 3.2 and 3.3), which\nleads to better understanding of some of the GR 3-space approach results. First, we ﬁnd that in BF´ O’s\napproach, strong gravity theories impose an ultralocal structure rather than a Lorentz one, and that they\ncause the breakdown of gauge theory, which reinforces BF´ O’s notion that the light-cone and gauge theory\nhave a common origin in the 3-space approach to GR coupled with bosonic ﬁelds. Second, we ﬁnd that\nmassive vector ﬁelds are readily included coupled to strong gravity. This helps clarify the central role of\nthe diﬀerential Gauss laws of electromagnetism and Yang–Mills theory in the masslessness of vector ﬁelds\nin the 3-space approach. Since the ﬁrst of these results includes the usual GR strong-coupled limit, it\nmeans that we have shown that gauge theory breaks down as one approaches the initial singularity of GR.\n2 Strong Gravity and the 3-Space Approach\nWe are interested in ﬁnding consistent theories of evolving 3-geometries; we use BF´ O’s 3-space approach\nto construct them. Consider then the following best-matched, reparametrization-invariant action,\nSBSW =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\nd3x\n√\ng\n√\nsR + Λ\np\nTW. (9)\nThe supermetric whose inverse Gabcd\nW is used in the construction of TW is\nGXabcd =\n1\n√\ng\n￿\ngacgbd −\nX\n2\ngabgcd\n￿\n, (10)\nfor\nX =\n2W\n3W − 1\n, (11)so that the DeWitt case W = 1 corresponds to X = 1, and W = 0 corresponds to X = 0. W = 1\n3 is\nexcluded from the treatment on grounds of noninvertibility.\nThe canonical gravitational momenta are\npij ≡\n∂L\n∂ ˙ gij\n= G\nijcd\nW\n1\n2N\n(˙ gcd − 2∇(cξd)), (12)\nwhere 2N =\np\nTW/(sR + Λ). We can invert (12) to ﬁnd an expression for ˙ gij.\nThe primary Hamiltonian constraint follows directly from the local square-root form of the Lagrangian.\nSince this statement is important and recurrent in our work, we provide here its derivation and interpre-\ntation:\nGXijklpijpkl = GXijklG\nijcd\nW\n1\n2N(˙ gcd − 2∇(cξd))Gklab\nW\n1\n2N(˙ gab − 2∇(aξb)) =\n√\ng\nTW\n(2N)2 =\n√\ng(sR + Λ), (13)\nby (12) and (8). Hence the momenta are not independent, but rather there is a relation between them,\nH ≡\n1\n√\ng\n￿\npijpij −\nX\n2\np2\n￿\n−\n√\ng(sR + Λ) = 0, (14)\nwhere p is the trace of pij. Such a relation between the momenta is called a constraint; it is called primary\nto indicate that variation was not used in its derivation. Constraints arising from variation are called\nsecondary; variation with respect to ξi yields the secondary momentum constraint\nHi ≡ −2∇jpi\nj = 0. (15)\nIf we can solve this as a diﬀerential equation for ξi (which is the thin sandwich conjecture [27]), then one\nis actually working on superspace.\nThe Euler–Lagrange equations are\n∂pij\n∂λ = δL\nδgij =\n√\ngNgij(sR + Λ) −\n√\ngsNRij − 2N √\ng\n￿\npimpm\nj − X\n2 pijp\n￿\n+\n√\ngs(N;ij − gij∇2N) + £ξpij,\n(16)\nfrom which we evaluate ˙ H:\n∂\n∂λ\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2\n￿\n−\n√\ng(sR + Λ)\ni\n=\nNp(3X−2)\n2\n√\ng\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2\n￿\n−\n√\ng(sR + Λ)\ni\n+£ξ\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2\n￿\n−\n√\ng(sR + Λ)\ni\n− 2s\nN (N2pab\n;b);a + 2s\nN (1 − X)\n￿\nN2p;a\n￿;a .\n(17)\nWe demand that this vanishes weakly in the sense of Dirac [8], i.e. that it is zero modulo the constraints\nhitherto found, which we denote by the symbol ≈: ˙ H ≈ 0. Notice that expression (17) has been grouped\nso that the ﬁrst two terms vanish by virtue of the Hamiltonian constraint and the third vanishes by virtue\nof the momentum constraint, which is thus an integrability condition for the Hamiltonian constraint in\nGR. Thus we are left with just the last term.\nSupposing that this does not automatically vanish, then we would require new constraints. But we can\napply exhaustive arguments as spelled out in general in [9], which rather cut down on how many further\nconstraints can arise, since these quickly use up the theory’s degrees of freedom.\nThere are three possibilities for (17) to be consistent. First, p;a = 0, which gives a further constraint\np/\n√\ng = const. Then we require furthermore that the new constraint propagates. This gives additionally\nthe constant mean curvature (CMC) slicing equation\n∂\n∂λ\n \np\n√\ng\n!\n= C = 3ΛN + 2s(NR − ∇2N) +\n(3X − 2)Np2\n2g\n, (18)\n(for C a spatial constant) which nontrivially ﬁxes the lapse N provided that s  = 0. This demonstrates\nthat arbitrary geometries cannot be connected, which for s  = 0 forces us to take the second possibility:\nthat X takes its DeWitt value X = 1. This is the main result, ‘Relativity Without Relativity’, of BF´ O’s\npaper, whereby GR is recovered. Giulini had also noted that X = 1 is mathematically special [25].\nBut clearly s = 0 gives a third possibility, for which any ultralocal supermetric is allowed. The theory\ntraditionally called strong gravity has W = 1 because it is obtained as a truncation of GR. But our ﬁrst\nresult is that as far as dynamical consistency is concerned, we have now shown that there exists a familyof such theories parametrized by W. Because W = 1/3 is badly behaved, the family of dynamically-\nconsistent theories naturally splits into W > 1/3 and W < 1/3 subfamilies. The W < 1/3 family should be\nqualitatively distinct from a quantum-mechanical perspective, as outlined at the end of the next subsection.\nA particularly simple example of such a dynamically-consistent theory is the W = 0 theory, for which the\nconstraints are\npabpab = gΛ, pij\n;j = 0. (19)\nW = 0 may be of particular relevance, in part because conformal gravity has been formulated i.t.o the\nW = 0 supermetric, and in part from string-theoretic considerations (see next subsection). Conformal\ngravity arises because, in a conformal generalization of the above working, the equivalent of the slicing\nequation (18) is independently guaranteed to hold. There is also a separate strong conformal theory [13].\nSince for s = 0 (17) reduces to\n˙ H =\n(3X − 2)Np\n2\n√\ng\nH + £ξH, (20)\nthe momentum constraint may no longer be seen to arise as an integrability condition. This fact was\nalready noted by Henneaux [17]. Strong gravity thus provides a counterexample to the suggestion that\nall additional constraints need arise from the propagation of H. However, all the other constraints can\nbe interpreted as arising in this way in the standard approach to GR [28]: Hi, the electromagnetic Gauss\nconstraint G, the Yang–Mills Gauss constraint GJ and the ‘locally Lorentz’ constraint JAB from working\nin some ﬁrst order formalism.\nIt is also dynamically consistent [29] to have strong gravity without a momentum constraint Hi to\nstart oﬀ with; the new W  = 1 theories may be treated in this way too. In fact, it is this treatment that\ncorresponds to strictly taking the G −→ ∞ limit of GR (as opposed to Pilati’s approach [30] in which the\nmomentum constraint is kept). This is because the GR momenta are proportional to G−1 [23]. So there\nare distinct strong gravity theories with 5 and 2 degrees of freedom per space point respectively. Also,\nif one uses Ashtekar variables in place of the traditional ones, the analogues of Hi and JAB cease to be\nindependent, so one is forced to have the theory with 5 degrees of freedom. [23].\nStarting oﬀ without a momentum constraint ammounts to starting oﬀ with ‘bare velocities’ rather\nthan best-matched ones, which corresponds to another 3-space scheme suggested in the GR case by ´ O\nMurchadha [31]. Our generalization to arbitrary s of this leads to\n˙ H = −\n2s\nN\n(N2[pab\n;b + (X − 1)p;a]);a +\n(3X − 2)Np\n2\n√\ng\nH. (21)\nFor s  = 0, pab\n;b + (X − 1)p;a = 0. But propagating this gives\n∂\n∂λ[pab\n;b + (X − 1)p;a] = (X − 1)\n￿h\n2s(NR − ∇2N) + 3NΛ +\nN(3X−2)p2\n2g\ni;a\n−\n(3X−2)Np\n2\n￿\np √\ng\n￿;a￿\n− 1\n2N(N2H);a − 2N √\ng\n￿\npam − 1\n2gamp\n￿\npb\nm;b,\n(22)\nso if constraints alone arise (rather than conditions on N), we require X = 1 and we recover relativity:\nthe constraint Ha ≡ −2pab\n;b = 0 may be encoded into the bare action by the introduction of an auxiliary\nvariable ξa. This encoding may be thought of as the content of best matching. Clearly, the s = 0 example is\nof value because it illustrates that it is possible to ‘miss out’ constraints if we interpret these as integrability\nconditions for H. Thus although the ‘bare’ and ‘best-matched’ schemes are equivalent for pure GR, they\nare not in general equivalent.\n2.1 Application to Scalar-Tensor Theories\nThe X  = 1 departure from the DeWitt supermetric does not appear to aﬀect Henneaux’s study of the\ngeometry. Whereas these theories are no longer interpretable as truncations of GR, they do correspond\nto truncations of scalar-tensor theories (such as Brans–Dicke theory), in a region where the scalar ﬁeld is\na large constant. The relations between the Brans–Dicke parameter ω and our coeﬃcients W and X are\nshown in Fig. 2. We now discuss the possibility that a positive-deﬁnite (W < 1\n3 i.e ω < 0) inner product\ncan occur in our universe. There is no point in considering Brans–Dicke theory since this has ω constant\nin space and time and we know from solar system tests that today ω ≥ 3500 [32], corresponding to Wbeing very slightly larger than the GR value 1. However, general scalar-tensor theory permits ω to vary\nwith space and in particular time, so it could be that the very early universe had a very diﬀerent value of\nω from that around us today, since the bounds on ω from nucleosynthesis [33] permit\nωnucleosynthesis\nωtoday\n≈ 1\n25.\nThe bounds from [35] are less strict but presumably applicable to a wider range of theories since the origin\nof the departure from W  = 1 (i.e ω  = ∞) is there unspeciﬁed. Furthermore, ω is attracted to the GR value\nat late times in scalar-tensor theories [36, 37], so it need not have started oﬀ large. One would expect ω of\norder unity in any fundamental scalar-tensor theory [36]. For example ω = −1 arises in low-energy string\ntheory [38].\nIt is thus an open question whether ω at early times could have passed through the value 0. This\nquestion is interesting for the quantum-mechanical reasons given in the next paragraph. We ﬁrst wish to\nclarify the role of our strong gravities in such a study. Our strong gravity theories do not permit W (and\nhence ω) to change with time, so we are not suggesting to use these to investigate whether such a transition\nthrough ω = 0 is possible. But if such transitions are found to be possible, the very early universe could\nthen be described by scalar-tensor theories which have ω < 0. Then one of our strong gravity theories\nwhich behaves qualitatively diﬀerently from the usual W = 1 strong gravity corresponding to GR would\nbe relevant as the approximation near the initial singularity. We propose to study the possibility of having\nsuch a transition using the full scalar-tensor theories. Unlike their strong gravity limits discussed in this\npaper, for which this transition involves passing through a noninvertible supermetric,3 the full scalar-tensor\ntheories are not badly-behaved as ω −→ 0. This is because despite the degeneracy of the tensor (‘gravity’)\nsupermetric for ω = 1, what counts for the full theory is the larger4 scalar-tensor supermetric, which is\nusually well-behaved at ω = 0 because of the presence of scalar-tensor cross-terms in the scalar-tensor\nsupermetric, due to which the degeneracy of the 6×6 block is not suﬃcient to cause the whole 7×7 scalar-\ntensor supermetric to be degenerate. But in the approximation by which the theories in this paper arise\nfrom scalar-tensor theories the scalar momentum is negligible, so one is then left with only the ‘gravity’\nsupermetric.\nThus in principle there could be diﬀerent possible early universe behaviours which admit 3 diﬀerent\nsorts of strong gravity limits: ω > 0 (indeﬁnite), ω = 0 (degenerate) and ω < 0 (positive-deﬁnite). In each\nof these cases the natural inner product corresponding to the early-universe Wheeler–DeWitt equation\n(quantum Hamiltonian constraint) will be very diﬀerent. This will cause the early universe’s quantum\ntheory of gravity in the ω < 0 (and ω = 0) cases to be substantially diﬀerent from quantum general\nrelativity, which belongs to the ω > 0 case, by the following argument. Finding an inner product is crucial\nfor the physical interpretation of a quantum system. The natural inner product potentially provides an easy\nsolution to the problem of ﬁnding an inner product. But the natural inner product is only an acceptable\nsolution to this problem if it admits a probabilistic interpretation [26].5 Now, the arguments for whether\nthe natural inner product admits a probabilistic interpretation depend on the type of the natural inner\nproduct: given a positive-deﬁnite inner product, one must check whether it admits a Schrodinger-type\nprobabilistic interpretation, which is a considerably diﬀerent procedure from checking whether a given\nindeﬁnite inner product admits a Klein–Gordon-type probabilistic interpretation.\nThe extension to W  = 1 of Isham and Pilati’s perturbative quantization idea of expanding about strong\ngravity ought to be both tractable and of relevance to such a quantum study of scalar-tensor theories. The\nidea involves expanding about the strong gravity theory by introducing a comparatively small R term.\nIn the GR case which alone has been investigated [18], one thus recovers a GR regime away from the\nsingularity.\n2.2 Application to Conformal Gravity\nAnother application of our W ≤ 1\n3 theories follows from conformal gravity being W-insensitive and thus\nexpressible i.t.o a W = 0 < 1\n3 supermetric. In fact, we can form a sequence of theories: W = 0 strong\ngravity, conformal strong gravity, conformal gravity. Thus we can isolate the study of some of the novel\n3In fact, this W =\n1\n3 supermetric is of the same form as the degenerate strong gravity 4-metric, so the pointwise geometry\nof superspace for W =\n1\n3 should be taken to be akin to Henneaux’s geometry of strong gravity spacetimes.\n4Just like the GR supermetric may be represented by a 6 × 6 matrix [2], the scalar-tensor supermetric may be represented\nby a 7× 7 matrix where the new seventh index is due to the scalar ﬁeld. For an account of this in Brans–Dicke theory, which\nalso explains how other-signature supermetrics can occur elsewhere in full Brans–Dicke theory, see [34].\n5In particular, the indeﬁnite natural inner product of GR does not admit a Klein–Gordon-type inner product. This is the\ninner product problem of quantum GR.features of classical and quantum conformal gravity: W = 0 strong gravity has a positive-deﬁnite inner\nproduct, and in strong conformal gravity additionally H begins to play a new role and there is a preferred\nslicing. Conformal gravity has in addition a nontrivial integro-diﬀerential lapse-ﬁxing equation to solve\n(Whereas strong conformal gravity’s lapse-ﬁxing equation merely integrates to give N = spatial constant),\nwhich represents an additional computational step before one can attempt to solve the evolution equations.\nIn answer to whether arguments from the Sec 2.1 are applicable to conformal gravity, we begin by\nnoting that there is no ‘expansion term’ p in conformal gravity. Because this absence is due to p = 0 being\nseperately variationally imposed (rather than due to W = 0 occurring for the vacuum theory), the presence\nof non-minimally-coupled-scalars or the related use of conformal transformations are unable to reintroduce\na p into conformal gravity. A consequence of this absence is that the usual notion of cosmology is not\napplicable to conformal gravity. It is not currently known whether any conventional or non-conventional\ncosmology can be recovered from conformal gravity by other means. Also, because p = 0 is seperately\nimposed, conformal gravity cannot be included among the ‘wider range of theories’ for which the less\nstringent bounds on W mentioned in 2.1 are applicable. Conformal gravity is a theory in which W plays\nno role at all. Presumably the classical and quantum study of conformal gravity on superspace with W < 1\n3\nand W < 1\n3 are equivalent once projected down to conformal superspace. Working out how this happens\nmay be interesting and instructive, at least from a theoretical point of view.\n2.3 Diﬃculty with Implementation of Ashtekar Variables\nThis paper proposes theories for which the inner product problem of quantum GR is altered (if not\nameliorated). In the case of conformal gravity, the presence of a preferred foliation additionally represents\nan attempt to circumvent the problem of time of quantum GR. One must however recall that these problems\nof quantum gravity are always intertwined with other formidable problems, which include operator ordering\nand regularization [26]. At least in GR, Ashtekar variables [39] have nice properties as regards these last\ntwo problems: the constraints become polynomial functions (cutting down on the ordering ambiguities)\nand a natural regularization is provided. It therefore becomes of interest whether scalar-tensor theories\nor conformal gravity admit an analogue of Ashtekar variables. Indeed, how special is GR in admitting\nAshtekar variables with their nice properties? The Ashtekar variables for GR [39] are an SU(2) connection\nAAB\na and its conjugate soldering form σa\nAB (which is related to the 3-metric by gab = −tr(σaσb)).6 One\nthen has the constraints\nDaσa\nAB ≡ ∂aσa\nAB + [Aa,σa]AB = 0, (23)\ntr(σaFab) = 0, (24)\ntr(σaσbFab) = 0. (25)\n(23) arises for the same reason as the JAB mentioned on page 5: it is a ‘locally Lorentz’ constraint\ncorresponding to the use of a ﬁrst-order formalism. Note that in the Ashtekar formalism, (23) has the form\nof an SU(2) Yang–Mills–Gauss constraint. (24) and (23) are the polynomial forms that the momentum\nand Hamiltonian constraints respectively, where Fab\nAB ≡ 2∂[aAb]\nAB + [Aa,Ab]AB is the ﬁeld strength\ncorresponding to Aa\nAB. One can see from a gauge-theoretic point of view that (24) is indeed associated\nwith momentum since it is the condition for a vanishing Poynting vector. The Hamiltonian constraint has\nno such obvious gauge-theoretic interpretation.\nBy including a cosmological constant term7 and passing to the strong-coupled limit of GR as above, it\nis simple to show that the constraints (23), (24) and (25) become (see also [23, 24])\n[Aa,σa] = 0, (26)\ntr(σm[Am,Ai]) = 0, (27)\ntr(σaσb[Aa,Ab]) − gΛ = 0. (28)\n6The overline denotes that the soldering form is a densitized object: i.e it contains a factor of\n√\ng. The capital indices\nin this section are spinorial internal SU(2) Yang–Mills indices. tr denotes the trace over these. Da is the SU(2) covariant\nderivative as deﬁned in the ﬁrst equality of (23), and [ , ] is the SU(2) commutator.\n7In Ashtekar variables, g is proportional to ǫabcσ\naσ\nbσ\nc, so the cosmological constant term itself is also polynomial.We can easily see, by the cyclic property of the trace and use of (26), that (27) is redundant as claimed on\npage 5. Furthermore, there is an equivalent form for the remaining constraints (26) and (28 ) [23], which\nwe express as\nA[ab] = 0, (29)\nAabAcdGabcd − Λ = 0 (30)\n(for Aab ≡ tr(Aaσb)), to manifestly display the dependence on the (now overall undensitized inverse)\nDeWitt supermetric Gabcd = 1 √\ngGabcd. We then investigate what happens when Gabcd is replaced by\nGabcd\nW . Notice how then the Hamiltonian constraint no longer contains a truncation of the natural object\nFab\nAB = 2∂[aAb]\nAB+[Aa,Ab]AB of SU(2) Yang–Mills theory, in correspondence with W  = 1 strong gravity\nnot being a natural truncation of the GR Hamiltonian constraint. We ﬁnd that whereas (29) and (30)\nstill close for arbitrary W, the closure of the original (26) and (28) requires the bracket in (28) to be\nantisymmetric, that is W = 1.\nFor full scalar-tensor theory, we do not think Ashtekar variable with W  = 1 will work. One has there\nthe option of making conformal transformations to put scalar-tensor theory into a W = 1 form, but the\nconformal factor required then causes the constraints to be non-polynomial [40]. As for conformal gravity,\nwe could as well write the theory with W = 1, but we see no way that conformal gravity’s analogue of\n(18) can be expressed polynomially. So for all these theories, we cannot so easily imitate the Ashtekar\nformulation means by which GR can be made to elude the operator ordering problem.\n3 Coupling Matter to Strong Gravity\nWe now attempt to couple matter to this theory, following the procedure of BF´ O. This enables comparison\nwith the GR case, and leads to a better understanding of how the 3-space approach works.\n3.1 Inclusion of Scalar Field\nWe include ﬁrst a single scalar ﬁeld by considering the action\nS\n(strong)\nBSWφ =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\nd3x\n√\ng\nq\nΛ + Uφ\nq\nTW + Tφ, (31)\nwith the gravitationally best matched scalar kinetic term Tφ = ( ˙ φ − £ξφ)2 and a scalar potential ansatz\nUφ = −(C/4)gabφ,aφ,b + V (φ).\nThe conjugate momenta are given by the usual expression (12) and by\nπ ≡\n∂L\n∂ ˙ φ\n=\n√\ng\n2N\n( ˙ φ − £ξφ), (32)\nwhere now 2N =\nq\n(TW + Tφ)/(Λ + Uφ). These can be inverted to obtain expressions for ˙ gij and ˙ φ. The\nlocal square root gives the primary Hamiltonian constraint\nφH ≡\n1\n√\ng\n￿\npijpij −\nX\n2\np2 + π2\n￿\n−\n√\ng(Λ + Uφ) = 0. (33)\nVariation with respect to ξi gives the secondary momentum constraint\nφHi = −2pij\n;j + πφ,i = 0. (34)\nThe constraint φH contains the canonical propagation speed\n√\nC of the scalar ﬁeld. A priori, this is\nunrestricted. However, imposing φ ˙ H ≈ 0 gives8\n∂\n∂λ\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2 + π2\n￿\n−\n√\ng(Λ + Uφ)\ni\n=\nNp(3X−2)\n2\n√\ng\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2 + π2\n￿\n−\n√\ng(Λ + Uφ)\ni\n+£ξ\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2 + π2\n￿\n−\n√\ng(Λ + Uφ)\ni\n+ C\nN(N2πφ;i);i,\n(35)\n8This has been obtained using a new method that uses the Euler–Lagrange equations implicitly, so we feel no need to\ninclude these cumbersome expressions in this or the next section. This method (similar to that used in [13]) will be in the\nauthor’s thesis.The theory has just one scalar degree of freedom, so if the cofactor of C in the last term were zero,\nthe scalar dynamics would be trivial. Thus one has derived that C = 0: the scalar ﬁeld theory cannot\nhave any spatial derivatives. So, strong gravity necessarily induces the Carroll group structure on scalar\nﬁelds present, thereby forcing these to obey Klauder’s ultralocal ﬁeld theory [16]. This is analogous to how\nrelativity imposes the light-cone structure on scalar ﬁelds present in [5].\nWe ﬁnally note that these results are unaﬀected by whether one chooses to use the ‘bare’ instead of\nthe ‘best-matched’ formulation.\n3.2 Inclusion of K interacting vector ﬁelds\nWe consider a BSW-type action containing the a priori unrestricted vector ﬁelds AI\na, I = 1 to K,9\nS\n(strong)\nBSWAI\n=\nZ\ndλ\nZ\nd3x\n√\ngL(gij, ˙ gij,AI\ni, ˙ Ai\nI,N,Ni) =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\nd3x\n√\ng\nq\nΛ + UAI\nq\nTW + TAI. (36)\nWe use the most general homogeneous quadratic best matched kinetic term TAI, and a general ansatz for\nthe potential term UAI. TAI is unambiguously\nTAI = PIJgad( ˙ AI\na − £ξAI\na)( ˙ AJ\nd − £ξAJ\nd) (37)\nfor PIJ without loss of generality a symmetric constant matrix. We further assume that PIJ is positive-\ndeﬁnite so that the quantum theory of AI\na has a well-behaved inner product. In this case, we can take\nPIJ = δIJ by rescaling the vector ﬁelds.\nThe UAI considered here is the most general up to ﬁrst derivatives of AI\na, and up to four spatial index\ncontractions. In the GR case, the latter was a good assumption because it is equivalent to the necessary\nnaive power-counting requirement for the renormalizability of any emergent four-dimensional quantum\nﬁeld theory for AIa [9].10 Then UAI has the form\nUAI = OIKCabcdAI\na;bAK\nc;d + BI\nJK ¯ CabcdAIa;bAJ\nc AK\nd + IJKLM ¯ ¯ C\nabcd\nAJ\naAK\nb AL\nc AM\nd\n+ 1 √\ngǫabc(DIKAI\na;bAK\nc + EIJKAI\naAJ\nb AK\nc ) + FIgabAI\na;b + MJKgabAJ\naAK\nb ,\n(38)\nwhere Cabcd = C1gacgbd+C2gadgbc+C3gabgcd is a generalized supermetric, and similarly for ¯ C and ¯ ¯ C with\ndistinct coeﬃcients. OIJ, BIJK, IIJKL, DIJ, EIJK, FIJ, MIJ are constant arbitrary arrays. Without loss\nof generality OIJ, MIJ are symmetric and EIJK is totally antisymmetric.\nThe conjugate momenta are given by (12) and\nπi\nI ≡\n∂L\n∂ ˙ AI\ni\n=\n√\ng\n2N\n( ˙ Ai\nI − £ξAi\nI), (39)\nwhere now 2N =\nq\n(TW + TAI)/(Λ + UAI). These can be inverted to give expressions for ˙ gij and ˙ AI\ni. The\nlocal square root gives the primary Hamiltonian constraint,\nAIH =\n1\n√\ng\n￿\npijpij −\nX\n2\np2 + πI\ni πi\nI\n￿\n−\n√\ng(Λ + UAI) = 0. (40)\nWe get the secondary momentum constraint by varying with respect to ξi:\nAIHi = −2pij\n;j + πIc(AIc;i − AIi;c) − πc\nI;cAI\ni = 0. (41)\n9Capital Latin letters are used in this section for tensorial Yang–Mills-type internal indices; we attach no importance to\nwhether these internal indices are raised or lowered, but their order is important in the GR case.\n10We shall however see that for strong gravity these ‘quantum’ conditions may be dropped.The evolution of the Hamiltonian constraint is then\n∂\n∂λ\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2 + πI\ni πi\nI\n￿\n−\n√\ng(Λ + UAI)\ni\n=\n(3X−2)Np\n2\n√\ng\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2 + πI\ni πi\nI\n￿\n−\n√\ng(Λ + UAI)\ni\n+ £ξ\nh\n1 √\ng\n￿\npijpij − X\n2 p2 + πI\ni πi\nI\n￿\n−\n√\ng(Λ + UAI)\ni\n− 4\nNOIK\n￿\nC1(N2πa\nIAKa\n;b);b + C2(N2πa\nIAb\nK;a);b + C3(N2πa\nIAb\nK;b);a\n￿\n− 2\nN ¯ CabcdBI\nJK(N2πIaAJ\nc AK\nd );b + 2\nNǫabcDIK(N2πI\naAK\nc );b + 2\nNFI(N2πIi);i\n+ 1\nNOIK\nh\nN2(pij −\nXp\n2 gij)AKb;d(2Ai\nICajbd − Aa\nICijbd)\ni\n;a\n+ 1\nNBI\nJK\nh\nN2(pij −\nXp\n2 gij)AJ\nb AK\nd (2Ai\nI ¯ Cajbd − Aa\nI ¯ Cijbd)\ni\n;a\n+ 1\nNFI\nh\nN2(pij −\nXp\n2 gij)(2Ai\nIgaj − Aa\nIgij)\ni\n;a\n.\n(42)\nWe demand that AI ˙ H vanishes weakly. The ﬁrst two terms vanish weakly by the Hamiltonian constraint,\nleaving us with nine extra terms. Because we have less than 3K vector degrees of freedom to use up,\nnontriviality dictates that most of these extra terms can only vanish strongly, that is by ﬁxing coeﬃcients\nin the potential ansatz. Furthermore, we notice that all contributions to (42) are terms in N;a or are\npartnered by such terms. Since further constraints are independent of N, these terms in N;a are of the\nform (N;aVJa)SJ, and nontriviality dictates that it must be the scalar factors S that vanish. We proceed\nin three steps.\n1′) The ﬁrst, second, third, ﬁfth and sixth non-weakly-vanishing terms have no nontrivial scalar factors,\nso we are forced to have OIK = δIK, C1 = C2 = C3 = 0, DIK = 0 and FI = 0. The conditions on the C’s\ncorrespond to the vector ﬁelds obeying the local Carroll structure.\n2′) This automatically implies that the seventh, eighth and ninth terms also vanish.\n3′) The only nontrivial possibility for the vanishing of the fourth term is if BIJK = 0, in which case\nthe constraint algebra has been closed.\nIt is enlightening to contrast these (primed) steps with their (unprimed) counterparts from the GR\ncase [9].\n1) is the same as 1′) except that C1 = −C2 = −1/4, which corresponds to the vector ﬁelds obeying the\nlocal Lorentz light-cone structure\n2) is the same as 2′) except that instead of the automatic vanishing of the eighth term, one is forced to\ntake BIJK = BI[JK], which is the start of the imposition of an algebraic structure on the hitherto unknown\narrays.\n3) One is now left with K new nontrivial scalar constraints, which happen to form the Yang–Mills\nGauss constraint,\nGJ ≡ πa\nJ;a − gBIJKπI\naAKa ≈ 0, (43)\nwhere g = −4 ¯ C1 = 4 ¯ C2 will become the coupling constant. So the algebra is not yet closed; we have the\nfollowing further steps.\nPropagation of the new constraints requires that the MIJ and EIJK terms are killed oﬀ; the ﬁrst of\nthese conditions means that the vector ﬁelds are massless. Furthermore the propagation forces IJKLM =\nBI\nJKBILM and the Jacobi identity BI\nJKBILM +BI\nJLBIMJ+BI\nJMBIJL = 0. So in this case, one obtains\na gauge theory for which BIJK are structure constants. Finally, one is forced to have BIJK = B[IJK],\nwhich allows one to restrict the algebra associated with the gauge group to being the direct sum of compact\nsimple and U(1) subalgebras by use of the standard Gell-Mann–Glashow result [41], albeit in a slightly\ndiﬀerent way from its use in the ﬂat spacetime derivation of Yang–Mills theory. The new constraint\nmay now be encoded as the variation in a further auxiliary variable introduced according to the best\nmatching procedure corresponding to the gauge symmetry. Thus one arrives at the (3 + 1) decomposition\nof Einstein–Yang–Mills theory.\n3.3 Discussion of Matter-Coupling Results\nThe results of this section help clarify some aspects of the 3-space approach results for GR. First, notice\nalso how now that a family of supermetrics is allowed the matter dynamics is insensitive to a possible\nchange of supermetric, which is encouraging for the coupling of conformal gravity to matter ﬁelds.\nSecond, we can take further the view that local causal structure and gauge theory are manifestations\nof the same thing. By the BF´ O procedure, in the GR case the universal light-cone and gauge theory cometogether from the ˙ R term in AI ˙ H, whilst the absence of this in strong gravity ensures that the collapse of\nthe light-cone to the Carrollian line is accompanied by the breakdown of gauge theory: there is neither\ngauge symmetry nor a Gauss law. In the GR case, the quantum-mechanics-inspired positive-deﬁniteness\nassumed of the vector ﬁeld kinetic matrix PIJ then turns out to be necessary in the restriction of the choice\nof gauge group, so there would be a price to pay if one insisted instead on entirely classical assumptions.\nIn the strong gravity case, the absence of emergent gauge structure means that there is no such price to\npay for using classical assumptions alone. Provided that PIJ is invertible, the outcome of steps 1′) to 3′)\nis unaltered.\nWe see through what happens in the absence of the Gauss law in this paper that it is speciﬁcally this\ncharacteristic of the 3-vector theory that kills oﬀ the vector ﬁeld mass terms in the 3-space approach, rather\nthan some underlying principle for general matter. This is a useful ﬁrst insight into the status of mass in\nthe 3-space approach to GR. It is also easy to demonstrate that the general derivative-free potential term\nbuilt out of vector ﬁelds persists coupled to strong gravity.\nWe emphasize that our result concerning the breakdown of gauge theory is in particular a result about\nGR, although it clearly occurs for all our theories and the theories they approximate. As G −→ ∞ such\nas in the vicinity of the initial singularity, dynamical consistency dictates that gauge theory breaks down\nin GR. Gauge interactions become impossible as one approaches such a regime. This appears not be in\naccord with the view that gauge interactions persist in extreme regimes to form part of a uniﬁed theory\nwith gravity, such as in string theory. However, little is known about physics in such regimes, so this\nclassical GR intuition might not hold. If string theory can tame such singularities, the circumstances\nunder which gauge theory breaks down according to GR might not occur. However, it could even be that\nstring theory breaks down in such a regime, since according to one interpretation, stringy matter could be\na phase of some larger theory which breaks down in a high-energy phase transition [42]. Also, Carrollian\nregimes might arise in string theory under other circumstances, and exhibit diﬀerent behaviour from the\nstrong-coupled limit of GR coupled to gauge theory, as suggested by the recent Born–Infeld study [43].\n4 Conclusion\nWe have found by the 3-space approach a 1-parameter family of consistent theories of evolving 3-geometries.\nWhereas for the parameter value W = 1 the corresponding theory is well-known to be the strong-\ncoupled limit of GR, we have interpreted our other theories as similar limits of scalar-tensor theories, and\nargued that such scalar-tensor theories may describe our universe.\nFor the parameter value W < 1\n3, our theories exhibit qualitatively diﬀerent behaviour from GR, but sim-\nilar to the behaviour of conformal gravity. This qualitative diﬀerence shows up in the quantum-mechanical\nregime by oﬀering a diﬀerent resolution to the inner product problem.\nHowever, we have argued that this feature is unlikely to be simply combinable with the use of Ashtekar\nvariables.\nOn coupling matter, our theories enforce that this matter is ultralocal, just like BF´ O’s treatment of\nmatter enforces a local Lorentz light-cone structure on the matter. Whereas BF´ O’s treatment enforces\ngauge theory, the collapse of the light-cone structure in the strong-coupled limit is accompanied by the\nbreakdown of gauge theory.\nAcknowledgements\nEA is supported by PPARC.

We consider a class of actions deﬁned on\nsuperspace (the space of Riemannian 3-geometries on a given bare manifold). It has two key proper-\nties. The ﬁrst is symmetry under 3-diﬀeomorphisms. This is the only postulated symmetry, and it\nleads to a constraint linear in the canonical momenta. The second property is that the Lagrangian\nis constructed from a ‘local’ square root of an expression quadratic in the velocities. The square root\nis ‘local’ because it is taken before integration over 3-space. It gives rise to quadratic constraints\nthat do not correspond to any symmetry and are not, in general, propagated by the Euler–Lagrange\nequations. Therefore these actions are internally inconsistent. However, one action of this form is\nwell behaved: the Baierlein–Sharp–Wheeler (BSW [1]) reparametrisation-invariant action for GR.\nFrom this viewpoint, spacetime symmetry is emergent. It appears as a ‘hidden’ symmetry in the\n(underdetermined) solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations, without being manifestly coded into\nthe action itself. In addition, propagation of the linear diﬀeomorphism constraint together with\nthe quadratic square-root constraint acts as a striking selection mechanism beyond pure gravity. If\na scalar ﬁeld is included in the conﬁguration space, it must have the same characteristic speed as\ngravity. Thus Einstein causality emerges. Finally, self-consistency requires that any 3-vector ﬁeld\nmust satisfy Einstein causality, the equivalence principle and, in addition, the Gauss constraint.\nTherefore we recover the standard (massless) Maxwell equations.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTraditionally the 3+1 dynamical formulation of GR, with its associated Hamiltonian and Lagrangian structures,\nis obtained by projection from spacetime. Geometrodynamics has a four-dimensional symmetry from the start. In\ncontrast, the classic study of Hojman, Kuchaˇ r, and Teitelboim [2] starts with a three-dimensional fully constrained\nHamiltonian and requires its constraint algebra to close by reproducing the standard Dirac algebra for GR. In this\nway, they recover the ADM Hamiltonian. However, by insisting on the speciﬁc structure ‘constants’ of the Dirac\nalgebra, they still presuppose spacetime. In fact, this is unnecessary. We shall show that mere closure of the algebra\nis enough to obtain GR.\nWe shall begin by explaining how the Baierlein–Sharp–Wheeler action, which is at the centre of our investiga-\ntion, arose from the ADM formalism [3]. In the ADM approach, one starts from spacetime (a pseudo-Riemannian\n4-manifold). One observes that the ‘surfaces’ of constant label time are spacelike (Riemannian) 3-geometries. Ge-\nometrodynamics is the evolution of these 3-geometries. Choosing 3-coordinates, one gets a smooth curve of 3-metrics,\ngij(xi,t), i,j = 1,2,3 with xi the coordinates. The gij’s depend on the slice (labelled by t), on the coordinates and\non the point on the slice. The coordinates can be transformed because only the 3-geometry matters, not the 3-metric.\nMoreover, the transformation can be changed freely from slice to slice as well as from point to point.\nThe key concepts in the ADM formalism are the 3-metrics gij, the lapse N and the shift Ni. The lapse measures\nthe rate of change of proper time w.r.t. the label time, while the shift determines how the coordinates are laid down\non the successive 3-geometries. Prior to the transition to the Hamiltonian, the standard Hilbert–Einstein action for\nmatter-free GR is rewritten, after divergence terms have been omitted, in the 3+1 form\nI =\nZ\n√\ngN\n￿\nR + KijKij − trK2￿\nd3x. (1.1)\nHere R is the three-dimensional scalar curvature, and Kij = −(1/2N)(∂gij/∂t−Ni;j−Nj;i) is the extrinsic curvature.\nFrom here the transition made by BSW [1] is trivial. They ﬁrst replaced Kij in the action by kij = ∂gij/∂t−Ni;j−Nj;i,\nthe unnormalised normal derivative, to give\n1I =\nZ\n√\ng\n￿\nNR +\n1\n4N\n￿\nkijkij − trk2￿\n￿\nd3x. (1.2)\nThey varied this action with respect to the lapse and found an algebraic expression for it,\nN =\nr\nkijkij − trk2\n4R\n. (1.3)\nThis, of course, is clearly consistent with the ADM Hamiltonian constraint. In turn, this expression for N is substituted\nback into Eq.(1.1) to obtain the BSW Lagrangian\nI =\nZ\n√\ng\n√\nR\nq\nkijkij − trk2. (1.4)\nThere is a large class of four-dimensionally generally covariant theories of matter ﬁelds coupled to gravity in which\nthe Lagrangian is a sum of potential-type terms (like R) + quadratic products of the ‘proper’ time derivatives, all\nmultiplied by N. In all of them, one can repeat the process above, solve for the lapse algebraically and pass trivially\nto the BSW form.\nThe BSW action has attracted relatively little attention. It was initially proposed, especially by Wheeler, as the\nstarting point of a method of solving the initial-value problem of GR. The original BSW paper [1] formulates the ‘thin-\nsandwich problem’, which will be mentioned later. However, in this paper, we propose to take (1.4) as paradigmatic\nfor the dynamics of the universe. We shall recall some basic concepts and identify the two key properties of BSW-type\nactions. Then, in view of its relative unfamiliarity, we shall give a fairly extended outline of our approach, which we\ncall the 3-space approach.\nWheeler [4] called the set of Riemannian 3-geometries on a given topology superspace, which is the ADM conﬁgura-\ntion space and the space we shall use here. However, we actually believe that conformal superspace, which is obtained\nby quotienting superspace by three-dimensional conformal transformations, may well be the true conﬁguration space\nfor gravity [5], but in this paper we work in superspace. The fundamental object we consider is a ‘curve in super-\nspace’, a sequence of 3-geometries, labelled by some parameter λ. We use λ rather than t because in our approach\ntime emerges from geodesic-type curves on conﬁguration spaces. This timeless approach is motivated below and in\n[6].\nFor well-known technical reasons, we cannot work directly with superspace; to integrate and perform other key\nmathematical operations, we must introduce coordinates. Therefore the actual objects we consider are curves of\n3-metrics gij(xi,λ), for which we deﬁne an action A. It must not depend on the choice of coordinates, i.e., A must\nbe truly a function on curves in superspace rather than just on curves in Riem, the space of 3-metrics. This leads us\nto the ﬁrst key property of the BSW-type actions.\nWe know that A will depend on gij, its spatial derivatives, and also on its ‘velocity’ ∂gij/∂λ. Moreover, A must be\ncoordinate invariant. In the case of λ-independent transformations, all we need ensure is that the integrand of A is\na 3-scalar, i.e., that we use covariant, rather than ordinary, derivatives and that the indices upstairs and downstairs\nmatch. However, crucially, we must also consider λ-dependent transformations, i.e, ones that diﬀer from slice to slice.\nThey have the form xi → x′i(xj,λ) with inverse xj(x′i,λ). We now ﬁnd\n∂g′\nij\n∂λ\n=\n∂xa\n∂x′i\n∂xb\n∂x′j\n￿\n∂gab\n∂λ\n− ξa;b − ξb;a\n￿\nwhere ξa = −∂xa/∂λ, so the λ derivative does not transform as a 3-tensor. This is a general problem that arises\nwhenever the ‘points’ of a conﬁguration space have an internal (gauge) symmetry. Indeed, it will be argued in [7]\nthat this is the deﬁning characteristic of any gauge theory. In the present case, the ‘gauge’ corresponds to coordinate\ntransformations on space. We overcome this problem by having the metric velocity always appear as part of the\ncombination kab = ∂gab/∂λ − ξa;b − ξb;a, where we regard ξi as an arbitrary 3-vector ﬁeld and minimize the action\nwith respect to it as well as with respect to the metric. This process of adjusting for the gauge freedom is universal\nand is appropriately called best matching. It was introduced to implement the conviction of Leibniz, Mach and many\nothers that motion is relative [6]. We will write ξa;b + ξb;a = (Kξ)ab, because this expression is the Killing form of\nthe vector ξi. It is also the Lie derivative of gij along ξi. A further point is that we are constructing geodesic-type\nactions, which requires A to be reparametrisation invariant (see below). This will be guaranteed because ξi is actually\na velocity, so that the combination kij = ∂gab/∂λ − ξa;b − ξb;a is linear in 1/dλ.\nInitially, we consider actions which depend only on the metric and its velocity (and the vector ξ). We will later\nextend the conﬁguration space to include a scalar function φ(xi,λ) and a 3-vector ﬁeld Ai(xi,λ). The velocities of\nthese ﬁelds will also include best-matching corrections. Since they are based on the Lie derivative, all such correction\n2terms have a universal nature. However, their universal common origin manifests itself in remarkably diﬀerent ways\nbecause each diﬀerent bosonic ﬁeld has its own diﬀerent Lie derivative. Eqns. (1.1)–(1.4) together with the expression\nfor the extrinsic curvature show how best matching is implemented in GR through the Lie derivative. We shall show\nhow this fact coupled with the second key property of BSW-type actions leads to the novel derivation of GR.\nWe now turn to this second key property of BSW actions, the square roots, which make them similar to the action\nof Jacobi’s principle of classical mechanics. In fact, as Lanczos notes in his beautiful book on the variational principles\nof mechanics [8], Jacobi-type square-root actions were eﬀectively used by Euler and Lagrange in their application of\nMaupertuis’s principle. However, it was Jacobi who clariﬁed the mathematics and cleanly separated two diﬀerent\nprinciples. The ﬁrst is Hamilton’s principle based on the familiar T − V Lagrangian. It gives dynamical curves in\nconﬁguration space together with the speed at which they are traversed with respect to an independent external time\nvariable. The second is the principle now known as Jacobi’s principle, which merely gives the dynamical orbit in\nconﬁguration space independently of the speed at which it is traversed. It is, in fact, a geodesic principle based on the\nsquare root of a form quadratic in the particle displacements. In the Kepler problem, it yields the elliptical planetary\norbits. We shall be interested in their generalization to general dynamical systems.\nIt is important to distinguish between dynamical orbits determined by a Jacobi-type principle and group orbits,\ngenerated in the conﬁguration space by the action of a gauge group. For us, the most important example of a group\norbit arises from coordinate transformations on our 3-spaces. These correspond to 3-diﬀeomorphisms. All 3-metrics in\nRiem that can be carried into each other by 3-diﬀeomorphisms lie on one orbit of the three-dimensional diﬀeomorphism\ngroup. Since the notion of group orbits is well known, it is enough to mention it.\nHowever, it is necessary to say why Jacobi-type actions are needed in the attempt to treat the universe as an\nisolated dynamical system, as we do here. Newton took time as an independent existent. But it is read from clocks\nand ultimately cannot be anything but a clock reading. Clocks, in their turn, are simply mechanisms that participate\nin the universe’s dynamics. The theory of time and clocks must be derived from the dynamics of the universe [6]. The\nfact is that speed is not obtained by dividing an inﬁnitesimal displacement by an inﬁnitesimal time but by another\ndisplacement. This was manifest, even if easily forgotten, when the rotation angle of the earth was the measure of time.\nA moment’s reﬂection should persuade the reader that true dynamics establishes correlations between displacements,\nnot between displacements and time. Now a curve in a conﬁguration space is the complete expression of evolving\ncorrelations between displacements. Therefore, universal dynamics is the study of such curves. Moreover, the simplest\nsuch curves, i.e., the ones determined by the fewest data, are geodesics. This is why we study geodesics and Jacobi\nactions. For more details, see [6].\nIn Sec. 2, we present Jacobi’s principle for point particles. The Jacobi action is the product of the square root of\na potential term multiplied by the square root of a kinetic term. We shall discuss two diﬀerent Jacobi-type actions.\nOne is the standard, ‘good’, one; the other is a nonstandard, ‘bad’, one. In the ﬁrst, the quadratic kinetic terms\nof the particles are summed, and then we take the square root of the sum. In the second, we take the root before\nwe sum. We have found, to our surprise, that the ‘bad’ choice, which is realized in the BSW action (1.4), is a good\nidea. It leads to a massively over-constrained action but, almost by magic, selects GR, in the BSW form, as the only\nnontrivial case that works. We should like to mention here that, so far as we know, the ﬁrst person to realise that\nBSW both was a Jacobi-type action and that it had a local square root and thus was not of the standard form was\nKarel Kuchaˇ r. He pointed this out to one of us (JB) in 1980 (see e.g. [6]). Karel’s observation, which was followed\nover the intervening years by innumerable discussions with JB, was decisive for the eventual appearance of this paper.\nThus, we take a reparametrisation-invariant and coordinate-invariant Jacobi action of the form\nA =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\n√\ng\n√\nP\n√\nTd\n3x. (1.5)\nFormally, this is deﬁned on the Cartesian product of Riem (the space of three-metrics) and the space of the ﬁelds ξ\nconsidered earlier. However, the intention is to turn it into an action deﬁned on superspace by varying w.r.t. ξ. The\nparameter λ labels the ‘points’ on trial curves in Riem, g is the determinant of gij, the ‘potential’ P is a 3-scalar\nconstructed from gij and its spatial derivatives, and T is a kinetic term.\nWe assume that T is quadratic in the ‘corrected metric velocities’ kij. Then either the ‘good’ or the ‘bad’ square root\nmakes the Lagrangian linear in 1/dλ and reparametrisation invariant because of the dλ outside. Dirac [9] noted that\nany action that is homogeneous of degree one in the velocities will have canonical momenta that are homogeneous of\ndegree zero. They must then necessarily satisfy a constraint that is primary, i.e., follows without any variation already\nfrom the mere form of the momenta. Now Noether’s theorem (Part 2) tells us that reparametrisation invariance, which\nfor general actions of the form (1.5) just allows a uniform scaling of the velocities over the entire manifold, will yield\none constraint. In contrast, the ‘bad’ actions of the form (1.5) generate an independent constraint at each space point.\nThis mismatch between the constraints and the symmetry will be crucial.\nWe now seek stationary points of the action A (1.5) as a functional of gij and the gauge ﬁeld ξi. We ﬁrst compute\npij, the momentum conjugate to gij. This is the variation of A w.r.t. ∂gij/∂λ which, in turn, is identical to the\n3variation w.r.t. kij. The variation of A w.r.t. ξ is the variation w.r.t. kij (which is just pij), times the variation of kij\nw.r.t. ξ, which is just the gradient of the variation of ξ. We integrate once and get the standard ADM diﬀeomorphism\nconstraint, p\nij\n;i = 0. This result has nothing to do with the square root or any other structure of the action except the\nuse of ‘best matching’ to implement diﬀeomorphism invariance. As we add extra ﬁelds, we will get extra velocities, but\neach will have the appropriate Lie-derivative correction with respect to the same vector ξ. The striking universality\nof the results obtained later arise because all ﬁelds in nature are subject to the same diﬀeomorphisms generated by\nthe one single ﬁeld ξ.\nVariation of the terms that involve the extra non-metric ﬁelds will generate source terms in the diﬀeomorphism\nconstraint, but the universality of the Lie-derivative prescription ensures that their form will be independent of the\nLagrangian’s detailed structure. As a result, the diﬀeomorphism constraint seems to be kinematic in origin, reﬂecting\nmerely the 3-tensorial nature of the considered ﬁelds. This is wrong. The diﬀeomorphism constraint reﬂects one of\nthe two key properties of the dynamics, namely, that its purpose is to make the action depend solely on the group\norbits that constitute the points of superspace.\nBecause the coordinates are more or less freely speciﬁable at each point of the 3-manifold, the resulting symmetry\n(an arbitrary 3-vector at each point) matches the constraint (the vanishing of a 3-tensor divergence at each point).\nTherefore, we have no reason to expect that the evolution will fail to propagate this constraint.\nIn the terminology of Bergmann adopted by Dirac [9], the diﬀeomorphism constraint is a secondary constraint\nbecause it arises from variation (the associated primary constraint is the identical vanishing of the momentum con-\njugate to ξ because A does not depend on ∂ξ/∂λ). However, as noted above, there is already a nontrivial primary\nconstraint in the system. It follows from the mere deﬁnition of pij that a quadratic expression of the same basic\nform as the Hamiltonian constraint of GR vanishes identically at each point of the 3-manifold. However, if we put\nthe square root needed to construct a geodesic-type action outside the integral sign, we get an integral rather than a\npoint constraint. Then the single resulting constraint per manifold matches the one degree of freedom per manifold\ndue to the reparametrisation invariance. There is no longer an independent constraint at each point of the manifold.\nThis is why we say the ‘bad’ action (1.5) is over-constrained, and why it is no surprise that, in general, it does not\ngenerate sensible dynamics. We call the Hamiltonian-type constraint the square-root constraint because it arises from\nthe placing of the square root.\nOur initial motivation for studying the actions (1.5) was because the BSW [1] action for GR has this form. In Secs.\nIV and V we give a fairly complete account of the BSW action, especially the propagation of its constraints. We then\nmake the Legendre transformation from velocities to momenta and rediscover the ADM Hamiltonian with its well-\nknown complete freedom to ‘push forward the evolution of spacetime’ by diﬀerent amounts across the instantaneous\nspacelike 3-manifold. This remarkable property of GR, which goes by various names including foliation invariance\nand ‘many-ﬁngered time’, is thus the ‘hidden symmetry’ of the BSW action. It shows that an over-constrained system\ncan nevertheless be viable.\nSection VI contains our ﬁrst new result. We consider a general action of the form (1.5) on superspace. Speciﬁcally,\nwe assume: 1) T is the most general quadratic kinetic form allowed by a natural locality requirement; and 2) the\npotential term P is an arbitrary scalar function of gij and its spatial derivatives. We check the propagation of the\nconstraints by the equations of motion and ﬁnd that in general the square-root constraint is not propagated. We\nneed a ‘hidden symmetry’ in the Euler–Lagrange equations to match the extra constraints on the initial data. From\nthis over-constrained perspective, it is remarkable that nevertheless there exists a handful of actions (1.5) that do\npropagate the constraints. In them, T must have the standard DeWitt form (a result already obtained some years\nago by Giulini [10]) and P = DR + Λ, where D and Λ are constants and R is the scalar 3-curvature. By an overall\nscaling, we can set D = −1,0, or +1. The cases D = +1 and D = −1 give Lorentzian and Euclidean GR, respectively,\nboth with Λ as a possible cosmological constant. The D = 0 case is called strong coupling or strong gravity and is the\nlimit of standard GR for an inﬁnite gravitational constant [11]. One can further argue that the D = 1 case is the only\none for which the equations of motion can be written in hyperbolic form and thus is the only viable candidate for a\ndynamical system. All other actions force the 3-metric to be ﬂat and its velocity to vanish. Unlike the square-root\nconstraint, the diﬀeomorphism constraint is always propagated, as expected.\nIn Sec. VII, we see if the kinetic and potential terms for a scalar ﬁeld φ can be added to BSW gravity in the\nLorentzian case, which has an emergent ‘light cone’. Best matching uniquely determines the kinetic term, but there\nis wide freedom in the potential, for which we make the ansatz\nR → R −\nC\n4\ngabφ,aφ,b +\nX\nn\nAnφn. (1.6)\nThis is the standard (minimal-coupling) potential energy (with an arbitrary constant C) and a polynomial with\nconstants An. The polynomial, which could in fact be replaced by an arbitrary function of φ (but not its derivatives),\ngives no diﬃculty, but we must have C = 1 for the constraint algebra to close. Therefore, the canonical speed of φ\n4must match with the speed of the metric disturbances: the scalar ﬁeld must respect the gravitational light cone. This\nresult surprised us even more than the recovery of GR from pure 3-space dynamics, especially since the manner of its\nderivation showed clearly that we had found a possible universal method of generating the SR light cone. (Until we\nextend our approach to include fermions, we cannot claim that 3-diﬀeomorphism invariance coupled with the local\nsquare-root is the origin of the universal light cone.)\nThe result we have just described shows that minimal coupling (and with it Einsteinian free fall) arises naturally\nin the BSW approach. In Sec. VII, we also discuss a general range of ‘dilaton’ theories and show that, in many cases,\nthey can be written in the local square root form. Brans–Dicke theory is a special case of such theories. We express\nits ‘vacuum’ form as a BSW-type action. We further show that we can self-consistently couple in a massive scalar\nﬁeld in the Brans–Dicke frame. Therefore, it seems that Brans–Dicke theory is consistent with our approach\nLife becomes even more interesting when we try to couple in a 3-vector ﬁeld, which we denote by Aa (Sec. VIII).\nThe kinetic term is again uniquely ﬁxed. We consider a fairly general potential energy expression for Aa:\nUA = C1Aa;bAa;b + C2Aa;bAb;a + C3Aa\n;aAb\n;b +\nX\nk\nBk(AaAa)k, (1.7)\nwhere Ci and Bk are constants. We include, thus, all possible terms quadratic in the ﬁrst derivative plus a general\nundiﬀerentiated polynomial term. We ﬁnd that, at this level, the polynomial terms do not hinder propagation of\nthe square-root constraint but that we must have C1 = −1/4, C2 = +1/4, C3 = 0. Therefore, the potential-energy\nterm becomes -(curlA)2/4. This means that here too we recover the common light cone for the vector ﬁeld from our\nputative universal method.\nBut now there is an even more striking result. As we shall see, the structure of the 3-vector ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly\nmore complicated than in the scalar case. It generates not only the above three conditions on the three constants Ci,\nbut also an extra secondary constraint requiring the divergence of the vector momentum to vanish, essentially the\nGauss constraint. This too must propagate, and we can easily show it does so only when all the polynomial terms\nvanish. This means we have derived standard Maxwell electrodynamics. We ﬁnd this result truly striking. It suggests\nthat gravity, the light cone, and massless electrodynamics all arise from the local square root and the action of the\nthree-dimensional Lie derivative.\nIn a companion paper [12] we show that the 3-metric ﬁeld, the vector ﬁeld and scalar ﬁelds can interact among\nthemselves only in the form of complex scalar ﬁelds with U(1) gauge coupling to the vector ﬁeld and both scalar ﬁelds\nminimally coupled to gravity. Thus we obtain classical gauge theory. A paper just completed by Edward Anderson\nand one of us [13] shows that in the BSW framework 3-vector ﬁelds can interact among themselves only as Yang–Mills\nﬁelds minimally coupled to gravity.\nThe 3-space approach uses nothing but manifold geometry, the mathematics that arose when Euclid’s ﬁfth axiom\nwas seen to be independent and could be omitted. It uses topology and bosonic ﬁelds: scalar, vector, and 3-metric.\nAs geometrical objects, these are on a par. But their individual properties lead to a hierarchy. The 3-metric is ﬁrst\namong equals. Through its covariant derivative and determinant g, it creates tensor calculus and the densities that\npermit integration and variation. It creates the highroad of dynamics [14]. Moreover, the Lie derivatives impose a\nchain that arises from the intricate core of the metric Killing form: gravity, light cone, gauge theory. The eﬀectiveness\nof geometry in establishing this structure and logic in dynamics is impressive. Galileo said: “He who attempts natural\nphilosophy without geometry is lost.” He meant 3-geometry. Was spacetime an accident?\nII. SQUARE ROOT ACTIONS\nWe ﬁrst formulate Newtonian particle mechanics without time, using Jacobi’s principle. It describes the orbits of\nconservative dynamical systems in conﬁguration space without reference to motion. Jacobi’s principle is very well\nknown to N-body specialists, who geometrize motion in conﬁguration space by exploiting the Riemannian metric\ndeﬁned there by the kinetic energy of conservative mechanical systems [8]. However, it is virtually unknown among\nrelativists, who use spacetime to geometrize motion. We have here a ‘cultural divide’ that we hope the present paper,\nwhich suggests that the conﬁguration space is more fundamental than spacetime, will help to overcome.\nFor N particles, labelled by (m) = 1,...,N, of masses m(m) moving in a potential V (xi\n(1),...,xi\n(N)), the Jacobi\naction is [8]\nIG = 2\nZ √\nE − V\n√\nTdλ, (2.1)\n5where the constant E is the total energy, V is the potential energy, λ labels the points on trial curves and\nT =\nN X\n(m)=1\nm(m)\n2\ndxi\n(m)\ndλ\ndx(m)i\ndλ\nis the kinetic energy but with λ in place of Newtonian time. The subscript G on IG distinguishes the ‘good’ action\nfrom the ‘bad’ one introduced later. The action (2.1) is timeless since the label λ could be omitted and the mere\ndisplacements dx(m)i employed, as is reﬂected in the invariance of IG under the reparametrization\nλ → f(λ). (2.2)\nJacobi’s principle describes all Newtonian motions of one E as geodesics on conﬁguration space. Its square roots\nare characteristic, indeed essential, and are central in the 3-space approach. They ﬁx the structure of the action’s\ncanonical momenta, which are\np\ni\n(m) =\nδL\nδ\n￿\ndx(m)i\ndλ\n￿ = m(m)\nr\nE − V\nT\ndxi\n(m)\ndλ\n. (2.3)\nBecause T (quadratic in the velocities) occurs under the square root in the denominator while the velocity occurs\nlinearly in the numerator, the canonical momenta are homogeneous of degree zero. They resemble direction cosines,\nwhich, if squared and added, give 1. We have\npi\n(m)p(m)i\n2m(m)\n=\nE − V\nT\nm(m)\n2\ndxi\n(m)\ndλ\ndx(m)i\ndλ\n.\nIf we sum the kinetic energies, they give T, cancelling the numerator’s T. This gives the reparametrisation, or\nsquare-root, identity\nN X\n(m)=1\npi\n(m)p(m)i\n2m(m)\n=\nE − V\nT\n× T = E − V. (2.4)\nEquation (2.4) seems to express energy conservation, but it is actually an identity true on all curves in the conﬁguration\nspace and not merely on-shell. In the Hamiltonian formalism, (2.4) becomes a quadratic constraint.\nThe Euler–Lagrange equations are\ndpi\n(m)\ndλ\n=\nδL\nδx(m)i\n= −\nr\nT\nE − V\nd\ni\n(m)V, (2.5)\nwhere λ is still arbitrary. The solutions of Eq.(2.5) are, as they must be, parametrised curves in conﬁguration\nspace. Within generalized Hamiltonian dynamics [9], there is no guarantee that the Euler–Lagrange equations used\nto propagate the canonical momenta will do so in such a way that the identity (2.4) will be maintained. This is why\n(2.4), and any other identity like it, is to be regarded as a constraint whose propagation must always be checked. In\nthe present case, the Euler–Lagrange equations do conserve the constraint:\nN X\n(m)=1\np(m)i\nm(m)\ndpi\ndλ\n= −\nN X\n(m)=1\np(m)i\nm(m)\nr\nT\nE − V\ndi\n(m)V = −\nN X\n(m)=1\nr\nE − V\nT\ndxi\n(m)\ndλ\nr\nT\nE − V\ndi\n(m)V = −\ndV\ndλ\n. (2.6)\nBut this is not the end since λ is still free. If we choose it such that\nT\nE − V\n= 1 ⇒ T = E − V (2.7)\nthen Eqs.(2.3) and (2.5) become\np\ni\n(m) = m(m)\ndxi\n(m)\ndλ\n,\ndpi\n(m)\ndλ\n= −d\ni\n(m)V, (2.8)\n6and we recover Newton’s second law with respect to this special λ, which has the same properties as Newton’s absolute\ntime. However, Eq.(2.7), which is usually taken to express energy conservation, becomes, in the absence of an external\ntime, the deﬁnition of ‘Newtonian’ time. Indeed, this emergent time is the astronomers’ operational ephemeris time\n[6].\nWe now consider the ‘bad’ (suﬃx B) Jacobi action with square root and summation swapped:\nIB = 2\nZ √\nE − V\nN X\n(m)=1\nq\nT(m)dλ, (2.9)\nwhere E, V and λ have their previous meanings, and\nT(m) =\nm(m)\n2\ndxi\n(m)\ndλ\ndx(m)i\ndλ\nis the mth particle’s kinetic energy.\nWe will generalise this slightly by bringing the ‘E −V ’ inside the summation sign. Then each particle can have its\nown energy and potential, and we have\nI\n′\nB = 2\nZ N X\n(m)=1\nq\nE(m) − V(m)\nq\nT(m)dλ, (2.10)\nIn Jacobi’s action, the ‘distance’ in conﬁguration space is an N-dimensional Pythagorean sum, i.e., the square root\nof a sum of squares (with mass-weighted ‘legs’). In the new action, we add the ds’s along a line. In the ‘good’ ds, the\nchange due to a change in one leg depends also on what all the other particles are doing. This linkage is not present\nin the ‘bad’ ds.\nThe new canonical momenta are\npi\n(m) =\nδL\nδ\n￿\ndx(m)i\ndλ\n￿ = m(m)\ns\nE(m) − V(m)\nT(m)\ndxi\n(m)\ndλ\n. (2.11)\nNow to the point. Instead of just one in the ‘good’ case, there are now N independent identities, one for each\nparticle. They arise just due to the placing of the square root. For this one core mathematical relationship, we shall\nuse various names: reparametrization or square-root identity; Hamiltonian, quadratic or square-root constraint. The\nnew identities are\npi\n(m)p(m)i\n2m(m)\n=\nE(m) − V(m)\nT(m)\n× T(m) = E(m) − V(m). (2.12)\nThe Euler–Lagrange equations\ndpi\n(n)\ndλ\n=\nδL\nδx(m)i\n= −\nN X\n(m)=1\n√\nT(m)di\n(n)V(m)\np\nE(m) − V(m)\n(2.13)\ndo not now in general preserve the constraints (2.12). There are extra secondary constraints, one for each particle:\nd\ndλ\n￿\np\ni\n(m)p(m)i\n2m(m) − E(m) + V(m)\n￿\n=\np(m)i\nm(m)\ndp\ni\ndλ +\ndV(m)\ndλ = −\np(m)i\nm(m)\nPN\n(n)=1\n√\nT (n)d\ni\n(m)V(n) √\nE(n)−V(n)\n+\nPN\n(n)=1 di\n(n)V(m)\ndx(n)i\ndλ\n= −\np(m)i\nm(m)\nPN\n(n)=1\n√\nT (n)d\ni\n(m)V(n) √\nE(n)−V(n)\n+\nPN\n(n)=1 di\n(n)V(m)\npi(n)\nm(n)\nq\nT(n)\nE(n)−V(n) (2.14)\nHere, we inverted the expression (2.11) for the momenta to ﬁnd dx(m)i/dλ and substituted to obtain the last line.\nThis does not vanish identically and thus is a new secondary constraint. We cannot have such proliferation, so are\nthere any cases for which the expressions (2.14) vanish?\nThe easiest way to understand their implications is to consider special initial data. Suppose particle (1) is moving\nand all the others are instantaneously at rest. Take Eq.(2.14) for (m) = (2). If it vanishes\n70 = d\ni\n(1)V(2)\npi\n(1)\nm(1)\ns\nT(1)\nE(1) − V(1)\n. (2.15)\nThis requires di\n(1)V(2) ≡ 0. Taking diﬀerent (m) and (n), we ﬁnd di\n(m)V(n) ≡ 0∀n  = m, i.e., V(n) can only depend\non xi\n(n) and not on the other particles’ coordinates. Then from Eq.(2.14) we ﬁnd that all the secondary constraints\nare identically satisﬁed, with no restriction on V(n). The particles can each move in their own external potential but\ncannot interact among themselves.\nPhysically, the system starts oﬀ with one global reparametrisation invariance. However, each particle wants to be\nindependently reparametrisable. To see this, we seek an equation to propagate the kinetic energy T(m) of any one\nparticle. None exists. The direction of each particle is ﬁxed, but its speed is arbitrary. To see this another way, note\n[Eq.(2.11)] that the momenta are homogeneous of degree zero in the velocities. They depend only on the direction of\nmotion of each particle and not at all on its speed. The Euler–Lagrange equations (2.13) govern the momenta, which\nare directions, and thus say nothing about speeds. This is why the system makes sense only when the particles do\nnot interact. We may also note that the local square-root action is the sum of N independent single-particle Jacobi\nactions. The particles cannot interact; but if they do not interact each can be independently reparametrised.\nThe ‘bad’ Hamiltonian is illuminating. It is just the sum of the constraints, each with a Lagrange multiplier:\nHB =\nN X\n(m)=1\nN(m)\n \npi\n(m)p(m)i\n2m(m)\n− E(m) + V(m)\n!\n. (2.16)\nVariation w.r.t. the multipliers N(m) gives the constraints. Hamilton’s equations are\ndpi\n(m)\ndt\n= −N(m)d\ni\n(m)V(m),\ndxi\n(m)\ndt\n= N(m)\n \npi\n(m)\n2m(m)\n!\n. (2.17)\nThese are exactly the equations of motion (2.11) and (2.13) from IB with the identiﬁcation N(m) = p\nT(m)/E(m) − V(m). Once again the kinetic energy is seen to be undetermined.\nThe ‘bad’ action (2.10) evidently has interesting and important properties: The system is over-constrained and the\nconstraints do not, in general, propagate; the ‘defect’ acts as a ﬁlter, picking out the ‘simplest’ action; the special\naction has a ‘hidden’ symmetry (not explicitly exhibited in the action); the ‘bad’ Hamiltonian is just a sum of the\nconstraints. Alternatively, one could start with a Hamiltonian such as Eq.(2.16) which is a sum of constraints, each of\nwhich is quadratic in the (undiﬀerentiated) momenta. Now all one has to do is repeat the BSW reduction procedure.\nFirst one constructs a Lagrangian by means of a Legandre transformation. This will contain the Lagrange multipliers.\nThese are eliminated and one ends up back with Eq.(2.10). All these properties carry over to the extension of the\n‘bad’ Jacobi action (2.10) to a ﬁeld theory, in particular to gravity.\nIII. REPARAMETRISATION-INVARIANT ACTIONS AND GRAVITY\nAs we already said at the start, 40 years ago Dirac [9] and Arnowitt, Deser and Misner (ADM) [3] showed that GR\ncould be treated as a dynamical system on the conﬁguration space of Riemannian 3-geometries with ﬁxed topology\n(called superspace by Wheeler [4]). We work in this paper with compact manifolds without boundary; the extension\nto more general topologies (e.g., asymptotically ﬂat) is straightforward.\nWe now begin the programme outlined in the introduction. We shall consider a class of Jacobi-type actions on\nsuperspace. We will show that the requirement that the equations of motion be strongly local (in a sense to be deﬁned)\nand self consistent drastically restricts the actions. In fact, standard GR with locally Lorentz-covariant matter ﬁelds\nthat interact through the gauge principle emerges naturally. We begin with matter-free superspace and obtain pure\ngeometrodynamics.\nFor deﬁniteness, we take the compact manifold to be S3. We will actually work in Riem, the space of suitably\nsmooth Riemannian metrics gij(x),x ∈ S3. The equivalence classes {gij} of the metrics gij under suitably smooth 3-\ndiﬀeomorphisms on Riem are the points in superspace. Consider a smooth family of smooth diﬀeomorphisms x′i(xj,θ),\nwhere the label θ distinguishes the members of the family and the diﬀeomorphism goes to the identity map as θ → 0.\nThe general inﬁnitesimal 3-diﬀeomorphism of gij(x) is generated by the Killing form by\n∂g′\nij\n∂θ\n|θ=0 = Lξgij = (Kξ)ij = ∇iξj + ∇jξi, (3.1)\n8where ξi(x) = ∂x′i/∂θ evaluated at θ = 0, and L indicates the Lie derivative. The Killing form, with its multi-index\ncovariant derivatives ∇j, is the most intricate Lie derivative we shall encounter; propagation of its intricacy creates\ngravity and imposes deep universal structure on matter coupled to gravity. The Killing form drives it all through the\nsquare-root ﬁlter.\nWe seek a measure on superspace like the ‘bad’ Jacobi action (2.10). Consider two metrics on, say, S3, which we\ncall g(1) and g(2). We take coordinates with the same range, so that we can identify points on the two manifolds with\nthe same coordinate values. We can compute, at each point, the diﬀerence between the metrics as dgab = g\n(2)\nab − g\n(1)\nab ,\nwhere we take dg to be small but ﬁnite. We want a diﬀerence linearly proportional to dg, something like\np\n(dg)2.\nThere are two natural squares of a symmetric two-index tensor. One is the sum of the squares of the individual\nelements, while the other is the square of the trace. We include both with an as yet undetermined coeﬃcient, and,\nmaintaining maximum generality with strong locality, we consider the object\nτ = Gabcd[dgab][dgcd], (3.2)\nGabcd = gacgbd − Agabgcd (3.3)\nwhere A is the undetermined constant coeﬃcient. Clearly,\n√\nτ is a natural measure of the diﬀerence of g(1) and g(2)\nat one coordinate point. To ﬁnd the total diﬀerence between g(1) and g(2), we need to integrate over S3. To obtain a\nmore general measure, we can modulate\n√\nτ by some spatial function of the metric, which we call\n√\nP, to give\n∆(g\n(1),g\n(2)) =\nZ\n√\ng\n√\nP\n√\nτd\n3x. (3.4)\nLet us assume that all the unlabelled g’s are g(1)’s and integrate over the ﬁrst manifold. The second manifold is an\nequally good base that gives an answer whose slight diﬀerence is immaterial in the limit. It is clear that (3.4) is the\nnatural generalization to a ﬁeld theory of the ‘bad’ Jacobi action (2.10). We have merely replaced summation over\nparticles by integration over a ﬁeld.\nThis is a distance on Riem. To get a distance on superspace, we make diﬀerent coordinate transformations on each\nof the two manifolds, getting g′(1) and g′(2). We recalculate ∆(g′(1),g′(2)) and, in the key step, ﬁnd the minimum of ∆\nover all possible transformation pairs. The minimum, provided it exists, will be a function on superspace. In fact, we\nonly need to make transformations on the second manifold, because identical transformations on the two manifolds\nleaves ∆ unchanged.\nTo transform this ﬁnite-distance function ∆ into an inﬁnitesmal, consider a curve of metrics with label λ that\ninterpolates g(1) and g(2). Evaluate ∂∆/∂λ at any λ and get\n∂∆\n∂λ\n=\nZ\n√\ng\n√\nP\n√\nTd3x,\nwith\nT = Gabcd\n￿\n∂gab\n∂λ\n￿￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n￿\n, (3.5)\nwith Gabcd given by (3.3).\nTo take into account the λ-dependent coordinate transformations, we add a Killing form to ∂gab/∂λ, ∂gab/∂λ →\n∂gab/∂λ−(Kξ)ab, where ξ is a priori an arbitrary 3-vector ﬁeld. The ‘distance’ along the curve between g(1) and g(2)\nis now\n∆(g(1),g(2)) = extremum with respect to ξ of\nZ\ndλ\nZ\nd3x\n√\ng\n√\nP\n√\nT. (3.6)\nThe extremalization in (3.6) w.r.t. ξ, which we call best matching [6], makes ∆ into a measure on superspace\nand not just on Riem. We use the word measure, as opposed to metric, because we are actually about to create a\ndegenerate (albeit highly interesting) structure. The ideal, motivated in [6] by an idea that goes back to Poincar´ e,\nwould be to have a true metric on superspace with geodesics as dynamical curves. However, because we choose the\n‘bad’ action, we will ﬁnd that although a best-matching action is in principle deﬁned on all curves in superspace there\nare many curves joining two given points in superspace that have the same action. This degeneracy would not have\noccurred had we opted for the ‘good’ action. The consequence of our ‘bad’ choice coupled with the square-root ﬁlter\n9is to acquire an extra symmetry, which, unlike the 3-diﬀeomorphism symmetry on the conﬁguration space, acts on\nthe phase space.\nIt is worth relating this to the number of physical degrees of freedom of the gravitational ﬁeld, which is universally\nagreed to be two if one rules out tensor–scalar gravity of Brans–Dicke type. Now, since the 3 × 3 symmetric tensor\ngij has six independent components of which three correspond to coordinate freedom, a true geodesic theory on\nsuperspace must have three physical degrees of freedom per space point. Our ‘bad’ choice introduces an extra scalar\nsymmetry and takes us down to two physical degrees of freedom. Our readers might begin to suspect that we are\nmerely taking them on a roundabout route to standard GR.\nTo counter this worry, we ﬁrst note that even if it is indirect the way is new. We get to the goal with much reduced\nkinematics – there is no time and no presupposed Minkowskian spacetime structure in the small. More signiﬁcantly,\nwe get new insights into the origin of the universal light cone and gauge theory. We should also like to draw attention\nto our earlier paper [5], in which we apply best matching and a local square root on conformal superspace (CS).\nSince the 3-vector symmetry of the 3-diﬀeomorphisms is augmented on CS by the scalar symmetry of 3-conformal\ntransformations, the six degrees of freedom on Riem are directly reduced to 6 - 3 - 1 = 2 on CS. Remarkably, the use\nof the local square root in this case still acts as a ﬁlter of theories but does not reduce the physical degrees of freedom\nany further. There is no extra phase-space symmetry associated with the theory on CS. Since the coupling to matter\non CS has still to be worked out in detail, we shall not explore this route further in the present paper. But it does\nhint at interesting possibilities (see also [7]).\nReturning to the task in hand, the variational principle on superspace, the ﬁnal step is to seek the curve between\ng(1) and g(2) that minimizes the best-matching ‘distance’ between the two geometries . This is achieved by varying\nw.r.t. the metric gij.\nNote that T as written is the most general ultralocal (i.e., with the supermetric Gabcd dependent only on gij and\nnot on its spatial derivatives) quadratic form in dgij up to an overall constant (which cannot aﬀect the resulting\ngeodesic curves). As we noted, the ﬁrst term is the sum of squares and the second the square of the trace. The\nrelative contributions of these two scalar terms has yet to be determined, hence the coeﬃcient A. For A = +1, Gabcd\nis the DeWitt supermetric.\nThe above analysis shows that ξ in the action is the rate of change of a three-dimensional coordinate transformation,\ni.e., it is a ‘velocity’. Moreover, the action does not depend on the associated ‘position’ (three-dimensional coordinate\ntransformation). Thus, it appears that ξ should be treated as a ‘cyclic’ or ‘ignorable’ coordinate [8], rather than as a\nLagrange multiplier (a ‘position’ without a ‘velocity’). In fact, it will be shown in [7] that ξ, like all such variables used\nto implement best matching, is neither a multiplier nor a cyclic coordinate but a sui generis variable for which the\nvariation at the end points is not ﬁxed. The same analysis will show that in most cases, including the one considered\nhere, the treatment as a multiplier is valid, though there are cases in which it is not. In this paper, we shall therefore\nregard ξ as a multiplier, which matches the standard treatment in gauge theory.\nWe conclude this section by underlining the presence of the local square root in (3.6), i.e., the square roots are\ntaken before the integration over space. This is the analogue of the ‘bad’ Jacobi action. The analogue of the ‘good’\naction with ‘global’ square roots is\nI =\nsZ\nd3x\n√\ngP\nsZ\nd3x\n√\ngT. (3.7)\nSuch an action yields geometrodynamics with three freedoms per point. Moreover, the global square roots do not\n‘ﬁlter’. The one basic form (3.7) allows many instantiations. In contrast, mere consistency applied to candidates for\nP and T in (3.6) and its obvious generalization to scalar and 3-vector ﬁelds on Riem leads directly to matter-free\ngravity (Sec. V), to matter ﬁelds minimally coupled to gravity and obeying its light cone (Secs. VI and VII) and to\nthe gauge principle and massless electrodynamics (Sec. VII). These are all latent in (3.6). We must now make them\nappear.\nIV. THE BSW ACTION AND ITS HAMILTONIAN FORM\nThe Baierlein–Sharp–Wheeler (BSW) action [1] has the form\nABSW =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\n√\ng\n√\nR\n√\nTd3x, (4.1)\nwhere the ‘kinetic energy’ T is\n10T = (gacgbd − gabgcd)\n￿\n∂gab\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)ab\n￿￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿\n, (4.2)\nthe monotonic λ labels the 3-metrics gij(x,λ) on a curve in Riem, R is the scalar curvature of gij, and the other\nsymbols have been explained.\nAlthough it was not found in this way, the BSW action can clearly be derived from the ‘distance’ (3.6) with A = +1\nand R as the ‘potential’ P. We ﬁrst show that ABSW leads to the Dirac–ADM Hamiltonian. The Lagrangian density\nis L =\n√\ng\n√\nR\n√\nT, and the canonical momenta conjugate to gij are\npij =\nδL\nδ\n￿\n∂gij\n∂λ\n￿ =\nr\ngR\nT\n(gicgjd − gijgcd)\n￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿\n. (4.3)\nWe immediately observe their homogeneity of degree zero in the ‘corrected velocities’ ∂gab/∂λ − (Kξ)ab, which\noccur linearly in the numerator and quadratically under the square root in the denominator T. They deﬁne a [‘local’]\ndirection in superspace, as opposed to the direction and speed of ordinary momenta. The BSW action is therefore\ntimeless, determining only paths without speed in superspace. Just as squared direction cosines sum to 1, the BSW\ncanonical momenta satisfy the square-root identity\ngH = −pijpij +\n1\n2\np2 + gR = 0, (4.4)\nwith the trace p = gabpab. This identity is obtained by substitution of (4.3) into (4.4) and in generalized Hamiltonian\ndynamics is a primary constraint [9]. Another primary constraint is the identical vanishing of the momentum conjugate\nto ξi that arises from our taking it to be a multiplier. Then variation of (4.1) w.r.t ξi as a multiplier gives\n2\n r\ngR\nT\n(gicgjd − gijgcd)\n￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿!\n;i\n= 0. (4.5)\nThis, on using Eq.(4.3), gives us the secondary constraint\n√\ngHj = p\nij\n;i = 0, (4.6)\nwhich consists of three conditions per space point. We also have the as yet undetermined vector ξ, with three\ncomponents per point. We wish to interpret (4.5) as an equation for ξ. The solution of this equation is the well-\nknown thin-sandwich problem [15]. Suppose we can ﬁnd ξ as a function of gij and ∂gij/∂λ. We can then substitute\nthis back into (4.1) to get a measure on superspace that is determined solely by the 3-metric. The auxiliary multiplier\nξ will have been eliminated, and we should have a well-posed initial-value problem for gij and its λ derivative.\nThis is what the logic of the 3-space approach suggests. In fact, the thin-sandwich problem is burdened with diﬃ-\nculties [15], and one should see our Lagrangian as heuristic rather than practical. Fortunately, it leads unambiguously\nto a Hamiltonian form – the Dirac–ADM fully constrained Hamiltonian – that is much more tractable and in which, as\nYork showed [16], one can genuinely obtain a well-posed initial-value problem. Our motto is therefore: “Conceptualize\nin the conﬁguration space, calculate in the [constrained] phase space.”\nThe entire evolution dynamics is in the Euler–Lagrange equations for gij:\n∂pij\n∂λ\n=\nδL\nδgij\n= −\nr\ngT\n4R\n￿\nRij − gijR\n￿\n−\ns\nT\ngR\n￿\npimp j\nm −\n1\n2\np pij\n￿\n+\n r\ngT\n4R\n;ij\n− gij∇2\nr\ngT\n4R\n!\n+ Lξipij, (4.7)\nwhere Lξi stands for the Lie derivative along ξi.\nThe square-root identity forces the standard Hamiltonian to vanish identically, as it does for all Lagrangians\nhomogeneous of degree one in the velocities. Using Dirac’s generalized Hamiltonian dynamics [9], we consider\nH =\nZ\n√\ng(NH + NiHi)d3x (4.8)\nwhere N and Ni are position-dependent multipliers, and H and Hi are the constraints (4.4) and (4.6), respectively.\nVariation w.r.t. N and Ni imposes H = 0 and Hi = 0.\nThe expression (4.8) is exactly the Dirac–ADM Hamiltonian; H is the Hamiltonian constraint; Hi is the momentum\nconstraint; N is the lapse; Ni is the shift. The standard equations of motion that it yields are\n11∂gab\n∂λ\n= 2\nN\n√\ng\n￿\npab −\n1\n2\ngabp\n￿\n+ Na;b + Nb;a (4.9)\n∂pij\n∂λ\n= −\n√\ngN\n￿\nRij −\n1\n2\ngijR\n￿\n+\nNgij\n2\n√\ng\n￿\npabpab −\n1\n2\np2\n￿\n−\n2N\n√\ng\n￿\npimp j\nm −\n1\n2\np pij\n￿\n+\n√\ng\n￿\nN;ij − gij∇2N\n￿\n+ LNipij.

(4.12)\nIn fact, even after these identiﬁcations, the dynamical equations (4.7) and (4.10) diﬀer by a multiple of the Hamil-\ntonian constraint. This has no conceptual signiﬁcance because the constraints vanish, but such diﬀerences can be\nimportant in numerical work. Moreover, if in the ADM Hamiltonian one chooses N/\n√\ng instead of N as the inde-\npendent variable, then, as emphasized by York [17], the extra term vanishes, and one gets complete agreement. This\nshows that the BSW and ADM solution curves are closely related.\nHowever, they are not quite identical. The ADM lapse and shift are entirely free functions, while the BSW logic calls\nfor the solution of (4.5) for ξ. If this succeeds,\np\nT/4R is determined. It seems that the BSW initial data determine\na unique direction in superspace as distinct from the ADM ‘many-ﬁngered time’. This apparent discrepancy will be\nresolved in Sec. V.\nV. PROPAGATION OF THE BSW CONSTRAINTS\nFor consistency, the evolution equations of constrained theories must propagate the constraints [9]: initially zero,\nthey must remain so. Thus, we must have ∂H/∂λ = 0 and ∂Hi/∂λ = 0 by virtue of (4.7) and the deﬁnition (4.3).\nSince constraint propagation is crucial throughout this paper, we shall exhibit it in some detail for BSW. We begin\nwith the momentum constraint Hi = 0, diﬀerentiating it w.r.t. λ and using the BSW (not ADM) evolution equations\n(4.7)–(4.11) to replace the λ derivatives of gij and pij. To simplify (and make the ADM connection), we write N in\nplace of\np\nT/4R. After cancellations and rearrangements, we are left with\n∂\n∂λ\n￿\np\nij\n;j\n￿\n= 1\n2N\nh√\ngR − 1 √\ng\n￿\npabpab − 1\n2p2￿i;i\n+ N;i√\ng\n￿\nR − g−1 ￿\npabpab − 1\n2p2￿￿\n− 2N √\ng\n￿\npim − 1\n2gimp\n￿\npb\nm;b + Lξ\n￿\np\nij\n;j\n￿\n. (5.1)\nThus, ∂/∂λ(p\nij\n;j) vanishes weakly [9]: if the constraint holds initially, it will propagate.

(In actual fact, when expressed in Lagrangian, as opposed to Hamiltonian, form,\nthe expressions within the square parentheses in (5.2) vanish identically. This vanishing is precisely the content of\nthe square-root identities. However, both here and in the equations below, we prefer to show these terms explicitly,\nif for no other reason than that they must be present in the Hamiltonian formulation, in which, as we already noted,\nthe Lagrangian identity becomes a true Hamiltonian constraint.)\nIn the light of the deﬁnition (4.3), the evolution equations (4.7) appear to give six equations for the six ∂2gij/∂λ2.\nThe fact that (4.3) propagate the four constraints tells us that only two of (4.3) are true evolution equations. Therefore,\nthe system is highly under-determined. In particular, we expect that ∂(p\nij\n;j)/∂λ = 0 should be used to solve for ∂ξ/∂λ.\nSince the constraint is preserved, we end up with no restriction on ∂ξ/∂λ. A similar situation is true for ∂N/∂λ.\nThe upshot is that N and ξ are ﬁxed on the initial slice by the initial data, but their evolution is free. Hence the\nfreedom in the ADM lapse and shift is eﬀectively shared by the BSW action, and both generate Einsteinian gravity.\n12In the local-square-root particle model, discussed in Section II, in the special case where the constraints are pro-\npogated the action reduces to a sum of single particle Jacobi actions. Therefore the action is locally reparametrisation\ninvariant even though it is expressed in terms of a glabal parameter. This is not true in the BSW action. The spatial\nderivatives in the scalar curvature are evaluated at a ﬁxed ‘time’. If we make a ‘local’ parameter change we will\nchange the surfaces of constant time and thus change the derivatives in a complicated fashion. Therefore the BSW\naction remains only globally reparametrisation invariant.\nVI. UNIQUENESS OF BSW\nWe have seen that constraint propagation is important. Many have sought conditions under which GR can be\nderived. Two main strategies have been followed. The older classical arguments, reviewed by Hojman, Kuchaˇ r,\nand Teitelboim (HKT) [2], relied on four-dimensional general covariance coupled with simplicity restrictions in a\nLagrangian framework. These essentially select the Hilbert action uniquely (up to an arbitrary cosmological constant).\nMore recently, Teitelboim [18] started from a Hamiltonian viewpoint and deduced matter-free GR by postulating:\n1) that the Hamiltonian should have the local form (4.8); 2) that H and Hi should depend only on the 3-metric\ngij and its conjugate momentum pij; and 3) that the resulting dynamics should satisfy an embeddability criterion\nproposed by Wheeler: “If one did not know the Einstein–Hamilton–Jacobi equation, how might one hope to derive it\nstraight oﬀ from plausible ﬁrst principles, without ever going through the formulations of the Einstein ﬁeld equations\nthemselves? The central starting point in the proposed derivation would necessarily seem to be ‘embeddability’ [in a\nfour-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spacetime].”\nAs Teitelboim noted in his PhD thesis [19], this is an extremely restrictive condition. Developing an approach of\nDirac [9], he showed that embeddability imposes a strict requirement on the Poisson-bracket relations between H and\nHi. They must satisfy the so-called Dirac algebra. In [2], HKT then sought theories in which the manner in which\nthe constraints close ensures embeddability and showed (again with certain simplicity requirements) that GR is the\nunique theory that does so.\nAs our ﬁrst new result, we show that embeddability is a much stronger condition than one needs. The constraint\nalgebra need not close in a speciﬁc way. It is merely necessary that it close. As we shall see, this opens up an\nentirely new derivation of relativity – both the special and the general theory – in which no a priori assumption of\ngeometrodynamic evolution of spacelike hypersurfaces in a four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spacetime is made.\nWe can derive relativity without relativity merely by postulating an action based on a metric ‘distance’ of the form\n(3.6) and requiring that its constraints propagate.\nBest matching, which ensures 3-diﬀeomorphism invariance, automatically leads to a momentum constraint of the\nform (4.6). The local square root leads to a local square-rootidentity like (4.4), which becomes a quadratic Hamiltonian\nconstraint like (4.5). We are led naturally to a local Hamiltonian of the form (4.8). Both constraints strongly restrict\nthe possible Lagrangians (or Hamiltonians) through the condition of constraint propagation.\nWe make no attempt at an exhaustive analysis and employ a pedestrian technique. We suspect our various individual\nresults could be obtained more elegantly in a uniﬁed manner but think it premature to seek it at this stage, since there\nare several extensions of the method, which we shall mention at the end of the paper, that should ﬁrst be explored.\nIn the meanwhile, our individual results show the potential of the 3-space approach.\nWe start with the simplest modiﬁcation of the BSW Lagrangian: changing the coeﬃcient A in the supermetric\nfrom the DeWitt value A = 1. The inverse to the supermetric is gaegbf − A\n3A−1gabgef because\n￿\ngaegbf −\nA\n3A − 1\ngabgef\n￿\n￿\ngacgbd − Agabgcd￿\n= δc\neδd\nf. (6.1)\nWe deﬁne\nB =\n2A\n3A − 1\n(6.2)\nbecause when A = 1 we also have B = 1.\nHence we start with a modiﬁed BSW action\nA′\nBSW =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\n√\ng\n√\nR\n√\nTd3x (6.3)\nwith\n13T = (gacgbd − Agabgcd)\n￿\n∂gab\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)ab\n￿￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿\n.

(6.5)\nThis can be inverted to give\n∂gij\n∂λ\n=\ns\nT\ngR\n￿\npij −\nB\n2\ngijp\n￿\n+ ξi;j + ξj;i. (6.6)\nThe square-root identity becomes\ngH = −pijpij +\nB\n2\np2 + gR = 0, (6.7)\nwhile the linear constraint that arises from varying w.r.t. ξ is unchanged:\n√\ngHj = p\nij\n;i = 0. (6.8)\nThe evolution is again in the Euler–Lagrange equations for gij:\n∂pij\n∂λ\n=\nδL\nδgij\n= −\nr\ngT\n4R\n￿\nR\nij − g\nijR\n￿\n−\ns\nT\ngR\n￿\np\nimp\nj\nm −\nB\n2\npp\nij\n￿\n+\n r\ngT\n4R\n;ij\n− g\nij∇\n2\nr\ngT\n4R\n!\n+ Lξip\nij. (6.9)\nWe use equations (6.6) and (6.9) to evolve the constraints, obtaining\n∂\n∂λ\n￿\np\nij\n;j\n￿\n= 1\n2N\nh√\ngR − 1 √\ng\n￿\npabpab − B\n2 p2￿i;i\n+ N;i√\ng\n￿\nR − g−1 ￿\npabpab − B\n2 p2￿￿\n− 2N √\ng\n￿\npim − B\n2 gimp\n￿\npb\nm;b + LNi\n￿\n(p\nij\n;j\n￿\n. (6.10)\nThe λ derivative of the momentum constraint, being proportional to itself, vanishes weakly, and so the constraint\npropagates.

(6.11)\nThe right hand side of (6.11) does not vanish weakly. It is clear that the trace p must satisfy the secondary constraint\np = constant. (6.12)\nThis is the well-known constant-mean-curvature (CMC) gauge condition [16], and it severely restricts the initial data.\nIt also forms a second-class constraint [9] with the Hamiltonian, with which it does not commute. When we evolve\nthis constraint, we get the standard CMC slicing condition:\n∇2N − RN = C, (6.13)\nwhere C is a spatial constant, essentially half ∂p/∂λ. This is yet another restriction on the initial data, and these\nresults show that we cannot connect arbitrary 3-geometries, i.e., points on superspace, by curves that extremalize the\naction based on the measure (3.6) unless A = 1.\nThus, a consistent BSW-type action with A  = 1 does not exist on superspace. We note, however, that the secondary\nconstraints just obtained, particularly the special case p = 0 of (6.12), arise naturally if gravity is treated on conformal\nsuperspace (CS) [16], [5]. We have already mentioned our belief that gravity will only be properly understood when\n14treated as a true geodesic theory on CS. We proceeded directly in that direction in [5], but we have since realized\nthat the diﬃculty presented by the condition (6.12) can be overcome in two diﬀerent ways: either on superspace with\nA = 1 or on CS with (6.12) imposed [5]. Characteristically, both ‘escape routes’ are indicated by our method. We\nalso mention that our A  = 1 result was already obtained by Giulini some years ago [10].\nWe have seen that the sole apparent freedom (the value of A) in the kinetic term T is illusory, and that best\nmatching and consistency ﬁx it uniquely. We now apply the same technique to the ‘potential’ P. One modiﬁcation\nworks. We ﬁrst show that P = Λ+DR gives a consistent theory with Λ as the cosmological constant and D is another\nconstant.\nKeeping the uniquely determined DeWitt T, we now modify the BSW action to\nA′\nBSW =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\n√\ng\n√\nDR + Λ\n√\nTd3x.

(6.21)\nThe right-hand side of (6.21) also vanishes weakly.\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, we can by multiplying by an overall scaling factor set D = +1,−1, or 0. The\nﬁrst case is standard general relativity with a cosmological constant, the second case is euclidean gravity, again with\na cosmological constant, and the third is strong gravity.\n15We now try to modify P more radically. Keeping to our pedestrian approach, we consider two special but illumi-\nnating cases. The ﬁrst is P = Rα with α a constant. Then, with the DeWitt T, we have\nA\n′\nBSW =\nZ\ndλ\nZ\n√\ng\n√\nRα\n√\nTd\n3x.

(6.27)\nWe use (6.24) and (6.27) to evolve the constraints.

(6.28)\nThis does not vanish weakly for any α except α = 1. We get the extra constraint R = constant. Conserving this gives\nyet another, unpleasant, equation. It is diﬃcult to conceive any solution of this system except static ﬂat space.\nAnother choice we tested was\nP = C1R2 + C2RabRab + C3∇2R, (6.29)\nwhere C1,C2,C3 are arbitrary constants. If gij is taken to have dimensions (length)2, then R will be (length)−2.\nNo scalar with dimensions (length)−3 can be constructed from gij . The only geometric scalars that have dimension\n(length)−4 are the three in expression (6.29). The other two obvious candidates, the square of the Riemann tensor\nand R\nij\n;ij, need not appear. The three-dimensional Riemann tensor can be written as a sum of the Ricci tensor and\nR, and the divergence of the Ricci tensor can be eliminated using the Bianchi identity.\nWe repeat the calculation, evolving the square-root constraint. This leads to an explosion of unpleasant non-\ncancelling terms that arise from the extra terms in P.\nOne soon sees that the same problems will arise for all possible extra terms. We conclude that BSW is the unique\nconsistent matter-free theory on superspace based on a ‘distance’ of the form (1.5). We believe that this is a new\nresult. In many respects, our calculations repeat those of HKT [2]. The novelty is our weaker assumption. The HKT\nassumptions are: 1) there is a local Hamiltonian constraint, quadratic in the momenta; 2) there is a local momentum\nconstraint; 3) the Poisson bracket of these constraints reﬂects embeddability. Our local square root is equivalent to\n1); best matching is equivalent to 2); constraint propagation on its own replaces 3). There is no need to presuppose\nspacetime. Already latent in (1.5), it is laid bare by consistency.\n16VII. SCALAR FIELD INTERACTING WITH GRAVITY\nThere exist matter-free solutions of Einstein’s equations on S3. Thus, there is an emergent light-cone structure in\nthe 3-space approach. Besides the pure-gravity light cone and 4-covariance (which we have recovered), the most basic\nrelativistic facts are the universality of free fall and the universal light cone (all matter ﬁelds respecting the gravity\ncone). If (3.6) is the basis of relativity, both of these further features should be implied by it.\nLet us see how a real scalar ﬁeld φ can be introduced. First, best matching essentially ﬁxes the form in which\nφ enters the kinetic term T. For φ is ‘painted’ onto the 3-geometries described by the 3-metrics gij, so that the\ncorrection to its ‘naive’ velocity ∂φ/∂λ, like the correction Kξ to the metric velocity ∂gij/∂λ induced by (3.1), is\npredetermined. It is the scalar product of ξ with the spatial gradient of φ: the matter is ‘dragged along’ with the\ngeometry by the diﬀeomorphisms. Technically, the correction term φ;iξi is just the Lie derivative of φ along ξ just as\nKξ is the Lie derivative of gij. The modiﬁed T is\nT = (gacgbd − gabgcd)\n￿\n∂gab\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)ab\n￿￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿\n+\n￿\n∂φ\n∂λ\n− φ;iξi\n￿2\n. (7.1)\nAs here, the coeﬃcient of the scalar kinetic term can always be set to 1 by absorbing a constant into φ. The obvious\nmodiﬁcations to the potential P are\nR → R −\nC\n4\ngabφ,aφ,b +\nX\nn\nAnφn. (7.2)\nThe ﬁrst addition is the standard scalar-ﬁeld term that gives rise to wave propagation. It has the same dimensions,\n(length)−2, as R. If the constant C  = +1, then φ will not have the same light cone as gravity and local Lorentz\ninvariance will be violated. The second addition is a general polynomial non-derivative self-interaction term for φ.\nFor n = 2 and A2 = m2/4, we get the standard mass term for φ. We need not demand that n be an integer. We have\ndropped Λ, but it can easily be restored. We include neither the higher-order metric terms excluded in Sec. VI nor\nhigher-order metric–scalar interactions. We expect that these too can be eliminated.\nThe metric momenta are\npij =\nδL\nδ\n￿\n∂gij\n∂λ\n￿ =\ns\ng(R + Uφ)\nTg + Tφ\n(gicgjd − gijgcd)\n￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿\n, (7.3)\nwhere Uφ is the φ potential term.

Note\nthat πφ;j from (7.8) completes the square of π2+1/4(∇φ)2 from (7.7). The 1/2 in (7.8) arises because the Hamiltonian\nconstraint has 16πρ, while the momentum constraint has 8πJi. These are obtained because of our best-matching\n‘dragging’ of φ, which leads to minimal coupling and the equivalence principle. Note that the divergence p\nij\n;i of the\ngravitational momenta no longer vanishes but equals the φ ‘current’ 1\n2φπ;j (the φ momentum density), while the\nHamiltonian constraint picks up (twice) the energy density.\nWe now come to the next constraint-propagation result. The momentum constraint propagates, as always, and the\npolynomial self-interaction terms (including the mass term) in the quadratic constraint cause no diﬃculty; the extra\nterms in its λ derivative cancel. But the coeﬃcient C produces non-vanishing terms. We have\n∂\n∂λ\nh√\ng\n￿\nR − C\n4 gabφ,aφ,b +\nP\nn Anφn￿\n− 1 √\ng\n￿\npabpab − 1\n2p2 + π2￿i\n= 2N;a\n￿\n2pb\na;b − πφ;a\n￿\n+ N\n￿\n2pab\n;a − πφ;b￿\n;b\n+ 1\n2Np\nh√\ng\n￿\nR − C\n4 gabφ,aφ,b +\nP\nn Anφn￿\n− 1 √\ng\n￿\npabpab − 1\n2p2 + π2￿i\n+ LNi\nh√\ng\n￿\nR − C\n4 gabφ,aφ,b +\nP\nn Anφn￿\n− 1 √\ng\n￿\npabpab − 1\n2p2 + π2￿i\n+ (1 − C)Nπ∇2φ + (2 − 2C)N;iπφ;i + (1 − C)Nπ;iφ;i. (7.12)\nAlthough most terms in (7.12) vanish weakly, the last three, all proportional to 1 − C, do not. They generate a\nsecondary constraint. This forms a second-class constraint set with the Hamiltonian and so generates yet another\nconstraint. In fact, the Hamiltonian constraint will not propagate unless C = 1. But this means that φ is forced to\nrespect the metric light cone.\nMoreover, the mechanism that enforces this will generate the universal metric–matter light cone – for bosons at\nleast, we have not yet considered fermions. The mechanism has several hinges, but the linkage is unbreakable. The\nkey is the presence of the scalar curvature R in the square-root constraint. The λ derivative of this constraint therefore\ncontains ∂R/∂λ. Now purely by kinematics\n∂R\n∂λ\n=\n￿\n∂gij\n∂λ\n￿;ij\n− ∇\n2\n￿\ng\nij ∂gij\n∂λ\n￿\n− R\nij ∂gij\n∂λ\n=\n￿\n2N\n√\ng\np\nij\n￿\n;ij\n+ ..., (7.13)\nwhere we use Eq.(7.4) to replace the time derivative of g with the momentum. The ﬁnal expression in Eq.(7.13) will\ncontain terms with p\nij\n;i. We now subtract πφ;i to generate the momentum constraint and obtain the ﬁrst two terms\non the right hand side of Eq.(7.12). This is the ﬁrst hinge. The extra πφ;i terms now appear as the C-independent\nparts of the last three terms in Eq.(7.12). The πφ;i terms with the factor C arise from two diﬀerent sources. The\n(∇φ)2 term in the Hamiltonian constraint has an explicit C in front of it. The time derivative of this term, combined\nwith Eq.(7.6) gives the term in the middle of the three. The other two terms arise from the time derivative of the\nπ2 in the square root constraint. To evaluate this we use the Euler-Lagrange equation for (φ,π), Eq.(7.10); the ﬁrst\nterm in this has a C in it. This gives the ﬁrst and third terms. This is the second hinge.\nTherefore, the constraint-propagation condition contains identical terms with and without the coeﬃcient. This is\nthe ﬁnal hinge in the light-cone generating mechanism, for it makes it inevitable that constraint propagation will\n18enforce C = 1. The universality of the mechanism is ensured by the universal nature of the momentum constraint:\nany ﬁeld of whatever tensor rank whose velocity appears in the Lagrangian with best-matched correction will be\nrepresented as a source term in the momentum constraint in a form solely determined by its Lie derivative. We shall\nsee in the next section that this mechanism has even more implications.\nFor the scalar ﬁeld, we have thus derived the correct light-cone behaviour of Lorentz-invariant ﬁeld theory and can\nsee that this will hold uniformly. We believe that this is a new result. We can also show that a derivative coupling\nterm in (7.2) cannot be included consistently in the potential of our Lagrangian.\nIt turns out that the fact that the ‘mass’ term in the scalar ﬁeld can be chosen quite arbitrarily, as we have shown\nabove, is part of a wider freedom. It turns out that a large class of what might be called ‘dilatonic’ theories can be\nwritten selfconsistently in BSW form. Let us consider a theory which has three constituents. One is the gravitational\nﬁeld, represented by a three-metric, gij; one is a massless scalar ﬁeld, φ (the dilaton); and the third is a ‘massive’\nscalar ﬁeld, χ. The key point is that we assume that the ‘mass’ of χ is some arbitrary function of φ, m2 = f(φ).\nWe further assume that both scalar ﬁelds are minimally coupled to the metric and that the kinetic energy takes the\nsimplest possible form.\nThis means that we assume the potential term is\nP = R −\n1\n4\ngabφ,aφ,b −\n1\n4\n￿\ngabχ,aχ,b − f(φ)χ2￿\n, (7.14)\nand the kinetic term is\nT = (gacgbd − gabgcd)\n￿\n∂gab\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)ab\n￿￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿\n+\n￿\n∂φ\n∂λ\n− φ;iξi\n￿2\n+\n￿\n∂χ\n∂λ\n− χ;iξi\n￿2\n. (7.15)\nThe square-root identity becomes\ngH = −pijpij +\n1\n2\np2 − π2\nφ − π2\nχ + g(R + Uφ + Uχ) = 0, (7.16)\nand variation w.r.t. ξ gives the momentum constraint\n√\ngHj = p\nij\n;i −\n1\n2\nπφφ;j −\n1\n2\nπχχ;j = 0. (7.17)\nWe need to consider the propogation of the square-root constraint. We know that most of the terms will take care of\nthemselves and we really need only focus on the derivative of f(φ). One place is in the Euler–Lagrange equation for\nφ\n∂πφ\n∂λ\n=\nδL\nδφ\n=\n√\ng\n2\n(N∇iφ);i +\n√\ngN\n4\nf′(φ)χ2 + Lξiπφ. (7.18)\nThis will feed into\n−\n∂π2\nφ\n∂λ\n= −\n√\ngNπφ\n2\nf′(φ)χ2 + .... (7.19)\nThe other place is in the time derivative of Uχ where we get\n∂f(φ)\n∂λ\ngχ2\n4\n=\ngf′(φ)χ2\n4\n∂φ\n∂λ\n=\ngf′(φ)χ2\n4\n2Nπφ √\ng\n=\n√\ngNπφ\n2\nf′(φ)χ2, (7.20)\nwhere we used Eq.(7.6) to replace the time derivative of φ with its momentum. The two terms obviously cancel. It is\nclear that we can replace the mass term in χ with a polynomial and have each coeﬃcient be a diﬀerent function of φ.\nPossibly the best known dilaton theory is Brans–Dicke theory [20]. It is interesting to see how this can be written in\nBSW form. Let us start with the simplest possible local square root form with just gravity and a minimally coupled\nmassless scalar ﬁeld. This means that we choose the potential and kinetic terms as in Eqns. (7.14) and (7.15) with\nχ ≡ 0. We now perform a ‘point’ transformation and change variables to (γ,Φ) via:\ngab = Φγab, φ = −\n√\n4ω + 6logΦ. (7.21)\nThe action changes to\n19√\ng\n√\nP\n√\nT =\n√\nγ\np\nΦ2R − ωγij∂iΦ∂jΦ − 2Φ∇2Φ ×\nr\n(γacγbd − γabγcd)\nh\n∂γab\n∂λ − (K¯ ξ)ab\nih\n∂γcd\n∂λ − (K¯ ξ)cd\ni\n− 4\nΦγcd\nh\n∂γcd\n∂λ − (K¯ ξ)cd\ni￿\n∂Φ\n∂λ − Φ;i¯ ξi￿\n+ 4ω\nΦ2\n￿\n∂Φ\n∂λ − Φ;i¯ ξi￿2\n, (7.22)\nwhere ¯ ξi = ξi and ¯ ξi = Φ−1ξi. We vary this w.r.t. ∂γcd/∂λ and ∂Φ/∂λ to get the momenta conjugate to γcd and Φ.\nThese are\npcd\nγ =\nr\nγP\nT\n￿\n(γacγbd − γabγcd)\n￿\n∂γab\n∂λ\n− (K¯ ξ)ab\n￿\n−\n2\nΦ\nγcd\n￿\n∂Φ\n∂λ\n− Φ;i¯ ξi\n￿￿\n(7.23)\nand\nπΦ =\nr\nγP\nT\n￿\n4ω\nΦ2\n￿\n∂Φ\n∂λ\n− Φ;i¯ ξi\n￿\n−\n2\nΦ\nγcd\n￿\n∂γcd\n∂λ\n− (K¯ ξ)cd\n￿￿\n. (7.24)\nThen the square-root constraint simply becomes the standard 3+1 Brans–Dicke Hamiltonian constraint and simi-\nlarly for the momentum constraint. The square-root identity becomes\nγH = −p\nijpij +\n1\n2\np\n2 −\n1\n(4ω + 6)\n(p − ΦπΦ)\n2 + Φ\n2R − ωγ\nij∂iΦ∂jΦ − 2Φ∇\n2Φ = 0, (7.25)\nand variation w.r.t. ξ gives the momentum constraint\n√\nγHj = p\nij\nγ;i −\n1\n2\nπΦΦ;j = 0. (7.26)\nThis constraint algebra will close because it is just a transformed version of a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld.\nThere is thus a one-to-one correspondence between solutions of the Einstein equations with a minimally coupled\nmassless scalar ﬁeld and the solutions of the ‘vacuum’ Brans–Dicke equations. The true diﬀerence between the two\ntheories is whether the Einstein metric g or the Brans–Dicke metric γ determines the geodesics. One way to test this\nis to add a second minimally-coupled scalar ﬁeld.\nTherefore, consider the Brans–Dicke action (7.22) and minimally couple a second, constant mass, scalar ﬁeld χ to\nit. To do this, we add ∆P = −Φ2 1\n4(γijχ,iχ,j − m2χ2) to the potential term and add ∆T = [∂χ/∂λ − χ;i¯ ξi]2 to the\nkinetic term. Rather than computing in the Brans–Dicke frame it is easier to see what is happening in the Einstein\nframe. Let us now undo the transformation (7.21). The Brans–Dicke ﬁeld translates into Einstein gravity with a\nminimally-coupled scalar ﬁeld. The kinetic term is of the standard form,\nT = (gacgbd − gabgcd)\n￿\n∂gab\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)ab\n￿￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿\n+\n￿\n∂φ\n∂λ\n− φ;iξi\n￿2\n+\n￿\n∂χ\n∂λ\n− χ;iξi\n￿2\n, (7.27)\nthe additional potential term becomes\nP = R −\n1\n4\ng\nabφ,aφ,b −\n1\n4\n￿\ng\nabχ,aχ,b − e\nφ √\n4ω+6χ\n2\n￿\n. (7.28)\nThis is a special case of the dilaton theories we discussed earlier. Therefore the constraint algebra will close both in\nthe Einstein frame and in the Brans–Dicke frame. Therefore Brans–Dicke ﬁts very naturally into the BSW framework.\nThe conclusion of this section must be that, when we consider scalar ﬁelds coupled to gravity and insist on a local\nsquare root action, we recover causality. The characteristic speeds of the scalar ﬁelds must coincide with that of\ngravity. Other than that, there is a large freedom in the detailed form of the scalar ﬁelds and in the way they interact.\nIn the next section we deal with vector ﬁelds. There we discover that the detailed form of the vector ﬁeld is rigidly\nprescribed. The only theory that ﬁts our framework is massless electrodynamics, we recover the Maxwell equations\nunambiguously.\nVIII. THREE-VECTOR FIELD INTERACTING WITH GRAVITY\nSince the kinetic and potential terms of diﬀerent ﬁelds are simply added separately to the potential and T and do\nnot mix unless an interaction between them is introduced explicitly, we can treat diﬀerent ﬁelds (scalar, 3-vector,\n203-spinor) separately. We now consider a 3-vector ﬁeld Aa. We use the covariant Aa as the independent object,\nmatching our use of the covariant metric gab and covariant shift ξa.\nThe correction to the 3-vector velocity induced by the diﬀeomorphism-generating ﬁeld ξ to implement best matching\nis as unambiguous as it is for the scalar ﬁeld. It is the Lie derivative of Aa with respect to ξ:\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n→\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− LξAa =\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− gbcAa;bξc − gbcξb;aAc. (8.1)\nTherefore we add a term\nTA = gad\n￿\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− gbcAa;bξc − gbcξb;aAc\n￿￿\n∂Ad\n∂λ\n− gbcAd;bξc − gbcξb;dAc\n￿\n(8.2)\nto the metric kinetic energy.\nThe additions UA to the potential are equally obvious:\nUA = C1Aa;bAa;b + C2Aa;bAb;a + C3Aa\n;aAb\n;b +\nP\nk Bk(AaAa)k\n=\n￿\nC1gabgcd + C2gadgbc + C3gacgbd￿\nAa;cAb;d +\nP\nk Bk(gabAaAb)k.

(8.12)\n21We now check for propagation of the constraints (8.9) and (8.10) under the evolution by (8.6), (8.8), (8.11) and\n(8.12). As expected, the momentum constraint propagates. In the Hamiltonian constraint, the simple self-interaction\nterms (with coeﬃcients Bk) with no derivatives of either Aa or gij give no problem at this stage. However, ∂H/∂λ\ncontains terms that are not proportional to the constraints. The full expression is\n∂\n∂λ\nh√\ng (R + UA) − 1 √\ng\n￿\npabpab − 1\n2p2 + πaπa\n￿i\n=\n2N;a\n￿\n2pb\na;b − πc ￿\nA ;a\nc − Aa\n;c\n￿\n+ πb\n;bAa\n￿\n+ N\n￿\n2pab\n;a − πc ￿\nA ;b\nc − Ab\n;c\n￿\n+ πa\n;aAb￿\n;b\n+ 1\n2Np\nh√\ng (R + UA) − 1 √\ng\n￿\npabpab − 1\n2p2 + πaπa\n￿i\n+ LNi\nh√\ng (R + UA) − 1 √\ng\n￿\npabpab − 1\n2p2 + πaπa\n￿i\n+ 4C1+1\nN\n￿\nN2πaA ;b\na\n￿\n;b + 4C2−1\nN\n￿\nN2πaAb\n;a\n￿\n;b − 1\nN\n￿\nN2πa\n;aAb￿\n;b + 4C3\nN\n￿\nN2πaAb\n;b\n￿\n;a\n− 2C1+C2\nN {2[N2A(b;d)Af(pb\nf − 1\n2pδb\nf)];d − [N2A(b;d)Af(pbd − 1\n2pgbd)];f}\n− 2C3\nN {2[N2Aa\n;agbdAf(pb\nf − 1\n2pδb\nf)];d − [N2Aa\n;agbdAf(pbd − 1\n2pgbd)];f}. (8.13)\nThe last six terms do not vanish weakly. They have to vanish, otherwise we get a family of secondary constraints\nwhich eliminates all the degrees of freedom. We can (and must!) eliminate most of them by choosing C1 = −C2 =\n−1/4,C3 = 0 (which means that UA = −(curlA)2/4). This still leaves us with πb\n;b = 0 as a new, secondary, constraint\nwhich we cannot eliminate. This is none other than the Gauss constraint.\nPropagation of this new constraint requires\n∂\n∂λ\nπb\n;b = +2\n√\ng\nh\nN\nX\nkBk(AaAa)k−1Ai\ni\n;i\n+ Lξπi\n;i. (8.14)\nThe only way to ensure propagation is to set Bk = 0 ∀ k. Therefore, the previously unproblematic undiﬀerentiated\npotential terms are incompatible with the extra constraint. In our scheme, a scalar ﬁeld can have mass (or power-law\nnonlinear coupling, say φ4) but a 3-vector ﬁeld cannot. Only the Maxwell 3-vector ﬁeld minimally coupled to gravity\nand locked to its light cone survives.\nSince only curl A appears in the potential, addition of a time-independent scalar to Aa, Aa → Aa + ∂aΛ, does not\nchange the action. This is the analogue of a time-independent 3-coordinate transformation. If, more appropriately,\nwe take a time-dependent Λ, we need to add the extra term −∂aΦ to (8.1). The role of Φ is to absorb the ∂Λ/∂λ\nthat arises from the ∂A/∂λ term. The ξ terms play just the same role in compensating time-dependent coordinate\ntransformations.\nIt is now is easy to build the divergence constraint πb\n;b = 0 into the action. We simply regard Φ as an independent\nvariable and vary w.r.t. it, just as with ξ. Thus we regard Aa as a gauge ﬁeld, so that πb\n;b = 0 becomes the Gauss\nconstraint. The full correction to (8.1) is now\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n→\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− Φ,a − LξAa =\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− g\nbcAa;bξc − g\nbcξb;aAc − Φ,a, (8.15)\nand we minimize w.r.t. Φ in exactly the same way as w.r.t. ξ. This ‘gauge best matching’ yields the Gauss constraint.\nThus, the only way we have found to propagate the constraints of a metric–vector BSW-type action is to take\nUA =\n1\n4\n￿\nAa;bAb;a − Aa;bAa;b\n￿\n= −\n1\n4\n(curlA)\n2\nT = Tg + TA = (gacgbd − gabgcd)\n￿\n∂gab\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)ab\n￿￿\n∂gcd\n∂λ\n− (Kξ)cd\n￿\n+gad\n￿\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− gbcAa;bξc − gbcξb;aAc − Φ,a\n￿￿\n∂Ad\n∂λ\n− gbcAd;bξc − gbcξb;dAc − Φ,d\n￿\n, (8.16)\nwhich is simply Einstein–Maxwell. There is, however, a technical point to note here. The Lie-corrected velocity that\nappears in the square parentheses in the ﬁnal line of (8.16) does not appear in the form generally encountered in the\nliterature. However, we can rewrite\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− gbcAa;bξc − gbcξb;aAc − Φ,a =\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− gbcAa;bξc + gbcAb;aξc − gbcAb;aξc − gbcξb;aAc − Φ,a\n=\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− gbcA[a;b]ξc − [ξcAc];a − Φ,a =\n∂Aa\n∂λ\n− gbcA[a;b]ξc − Ψ,a. (8.17)\n22Here, we have replaced the gauge variable Φ by a new scalar variable Ψ = Φ + ξcAc. This means that in (8.17) we\nnow have a term linear in the undiﬀerentiated shift which is just the familiar minimally-coupled Maxwell ﬁeld tensor.\nThe residual scalar part that results from this manipulation gets absorbed in the original gauge variable Φ, which is the\nreason why we denote this new composite scalar by Ψ. Two points are worth mentioning here: 1) The Lie derivative\nof a 3-vector ﬁeld becomes ambiguous if the ﬁeld is gauged, as is reﬂected in the heterogeneous gauge–diﬀeomorphism\nnature of Ψ; 2) we are obtaining highly sophisticated theories – Einsteinian gravity and Maxwell minimally coupled\nto gravity – essentially uniquely out of the 3-space approach but always only ‘by the skin of our teeth’.\nIt is illuminating to consider why a massive vector ﬁeld, which is a perfectly good generally covariant theory, is not\nallowed in the 3-space approach. As Giulini pointed out to us [21], the ADM decomposition for the massive vector\nﬁeld is quite diﬀerent from the massless case. While the momentum can be written as\nπa =\n√\ng\nN\n￿\n∂Aa\n∂t\n− FabNb − A0,a\n￿\n(8.18)\nwhich looks identical to the last term in Eq.(8.17), there is a major diﬀerence in that, while Ψ is a true gauge degree of\nfreedom and can be chosen arbitrarily, A0 in the massive vector ﬁeld case is ﬁxed. There exists a primary constraint\nthat the momentum conjugate to A0, π0, vanishes. The conservation of this constraint leads to\nπ\ni\n;i +\n√\ng\nN\nm\n2 [A0 − N\naAa] = 0. (8.19)\nThis is quite diﬀerent from the massless case, for which, of course, m = 0, so that the second term is zero and we\nget a constraint that is homogeneous (and linear) in the canonical momenta and contains neither A0 nor the shift.\nIt is this restriction to the canonical momenta that limits the physical degrees of freedom and indicates that the\naction is deﬁned on curves in the space that is the product of superspace and the transverse degrees of freedom of the\nvector ﬁeld. This matches our ideal of a geodesic-type theory. In the massive case, the restriction is lifted since the\npart homogeneous in the canonical momenta is now equal to a term containing what were previously purely gauge\nvariables. In whatever way one attempts to interpret this extra term, it is clear that the massive vector ﬁeld does not\nbelong to the class of theories in which best matching with a local square root is applied to bona ﬁde three-dimensional\ngeometrical objects.\nThus, we ﬁnd that a non-gauge vector ﬁeld cannot be coupled in any simple manner to the BSW action. For the\nreasons to be explained in the conclusions, we think it would be premature to attempt a rigorous no-go theorem, but we\nfeel the provisional result is already remarkable and even hints at a partial uniﬁcation of gravity and electromagnetism.\nThe fact is that in pure geometrodynamics the BSW action is essentially unique, and we have found only one vector\nﬁeld that couples to it: Maxwell. Since our approach exploits 3-geometry to the maximal extent possible but nothing\nelse, we can say that Maxwellian theory is uniquely inherent in Riemannian 3-geometries. We have already noted\nthat, within our scheme, the attempt to couple a single 3-vector ﬁeld to scalar ﬁelds leads to the standard U(1) gauge\ncoupling [12], and the attempt to let a collection of 3-vector ﬁelds interact among themselves leads to Yang-Mills\ngauge theory [13].\nOur result also gives further insight into the origin of Lorentz invariance. We begin with the ﬁeld Aa, which is as\nunashamedly three dimensional as the 3-metric. How does the full panoply of the 4-potential Aν,ν = 1,2,3,4, and\nthe electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor Fµν arise? The answer is that the extra (‘time’) elements arise from the combined\neﬀect of the Lie-derivative best-matching correction to the ‘bare’ 3-velocity ∂Aa/∂λ and from having to propagate\nthe new square-root constraint. Best matching and the local square root do it all. It is particularly striking that\nthe universal light cone and gauge theory arise from one and the same Lie-derivative correction mechanism. For the\nscalar ﬁeld, the terms generated by the Lie correction in the momentum constraint ﬁx one constant in the constraint-\npropagation condition and lock it to the gravity light cone. For the 3-vector ﬁeld, they ﬁx three coeﬃcients, with the\nsame eﬀect, and impose the Gauss constraint. So, in a way, light cone and gauge are the same thing. Both derive\nfrom best-matched gravity.\nSome results of this section are only partly new, since Teitelboim [18] showed that his postulates (see the end of\nSec. VI) enforce gauge coupling. As in the case of the HKT result [2], we obtain his result with a signiﬁcantly weaker\nassumption, and we also obtain the light cone and reveal its intimate connection to gauge theory.\nIX. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nHitherto it has always seemed that four-dimensional general spacetime covariance is the very essence of GR. Many\nphysicists have expressed strong reservations about the 3+1 Hamiltonian formalism. It is held to be against the spirit\n23of general covariance and incapable of encompassing the wide range of topologies allowed by GR. The restriction to\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes – a necessary condition for the Hamiltonian treatment – is often severely criticized.\nWe believe that the present work, if it can be successfully extended to the fermionic sector and withstands critical\npeer review, puts these issues in a diﬀerent light. The fact is that, in a choice between two diﬀerent theoretical\nschemes, there must always be a preference (in the absence of compelling experimental evidence) for the one that\nis more restrictive and, hence, makes stronger predictions. There are two respects in which the 3-space approach\ngives tighter predictions than the Einstein–Minkowski approach: it rules out many ﬁelds (the massive vector ﬁeld\nfor example) and, within the possibilities that remain, rules out many solutions, e.g., solutions with closed timelike\ncurves, which are not globally hyperbolic. These are potential beneﬁts.\nHere we should also mention the possibility of advancing to genuinely new physics. Our present paper does not\nactually predict any new theory. It merely slims down a class of theories long known to exist (all generally covariant\ntheories) and, within the restricted class, rules out exotic scenarios (time travel for example). However, given that\nthe treatment of fermions in curved space is so delicate, we do not rule out the possibility that the extension to the\nfermionic sector (if it succeeds) will bring further insights. There is also the possibility [5], already mentioned in\nthe paper, of extension of the idea of best matching to conformal superspace (CS). As yet, we have performed this\nextension only for the matter-free case, but the results so far obtained are promising. They suggest the existence of\na theory virtually identical to GR except for the elimination of scale as a dynamical variable.\nIf a full theory can be developed on CS, the implications are far reaching. In the truly scale-invariant theory that\nwill result, the Hubble red shift cannot be explained by the ‘stretching of space’, as it is at present. For the theory\non CS is designed precisely to eliminate such ‘stretching’ as a degree of freedom. According to the present standard\nmodel, the universe is both expanding and simultaneously changing its ‘shape’, i.e., becoming more ‘clumpy’. The\nexpansion is used to explain the Hubble red shift. In a scale-invariant theory, only change of shape is physically\nmeaningful, and it must explain the Hubble law though a gravitational red shift induced by ‘clumping’ [7], [22]).\nThus, the 3-space approach does have the potential to lead to very diﬀerent cosmological predictions.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the local square root creates a theory that seems to be maximally sensitive\nto all properties of Riemannian 3-geometries, as can be seen by comparing the global form (3.7) with the local form\n(3.6). The product of two global integrals in (3.7) cannot be as sensitive as the local form. Indeed, it seems to us\nthat the twin principles of best matching and the local square root may implement the Cartesian ideal of explaining\nall dynamics by geometry.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Domenico (Nico) Giulini for his constructive criticism and helpful insights, especially in connection with\nthe 3+1 decomposition for the massive vector ﬁeld. We thank Bruno Bertotti for pointing out the importance of\nestablishing the status of Brans–Dicke theory within our approach. Their input is largely responsible for the main\nadvances in this paper as compared with its original draft. Comments of an unkown referee on our original submission\nhave also led, we trust, to a signiﬁcantly clearer presentation. We also thank Edward Anderson for helpful comments.\nFinally, our title is an obvious tribute to John Wheeler.\n∗ Email: julian@platonia.com\n† Email: bzf@physics.umd.edu\n‡ Email: niall@ucc.ie\n[1] R.

History is a part of\nall science|I will mention some of the relevant events\nin the development of special relativity|but there is no\nattempt to present the material in a historical way.\nA common confusion for students of special relativity\nis between that which is real and that which is appar-\nent. For instance, length contraction is often mistakenly\nthought to be some optical illusion. But moving things\ndo not \\appear\" shortened, they actually are shortened.\nHow they appear depends on the particulars of the obser-\nvation, including distance to the observer, viewing angles,\ntimes, etc. The observer \fnds that they are shortened\nonly after correcting for these non-fundamental details of\nthe observational procedure. I attempt to emphasize this\ndistinction: All apparent e\u000bects, including the Doppler\nShift, stellar aberration, and superluminal motion, are\nrelegated to Chapter 7. I think these are very impor-\ntant aspects of special relativity, but from a pedagogical\nstandpoint it is preferable to separate them from the ba-\nsics, which are not dependent on the properties of the\nobserver.\nI love the description of special relativity in terms of\nframe-independent, geometric objects, such as scalars and\n4-vectors. These are introduced in Chapter 6 and used\nthereafter. But even before this, the geometric proper-\nties of spacetime are emphasized. Most problems can be\nsolved with a minimum of algebra; this is one of the many\nbeautiful aspects of the subject.\nThese notes, \frst written while teaching sections of\n\frst-year physics at Caltech, truly represent a work in\nprogress. I strongly encourage all readers to give me com-\nments on any aspect of the text\u0003; all input is greatly ap-\npreciated. Thank you very much.\n\u0003email: hogg@ias.edu\nAcknowledgments\nAlong with Caltech teaching assistantships, several NSF\nand NASA grants provided \fnancial support during the\ntime over which this was written.

I also thank the members of Caltech's\nastronomy and physics departments, faculty, sta\u000b and my\nfellow students, from whom I have learned much of this\nmaterial, and Caltech for providing an excellent academic\natmosphere.

Hogg\nPrinceton, New Jersey\nNovember 1997\niiiivChapter 1\nPrinciples of relativity\nThese notes are devoted to the consequences of Ein-\nstein's (1905) principle of special relativity, which states\nthat all the fundamental laws of physics are the same\nfor all uniformly moving (non-accelerating) observers. In\nparticular, all of them measure precisely the same value\nfor the speed of light in vacuum, no matter what their\nrelative velocities. Before Einstein wrote, several prin-\nciples of relativity had been proposed, but Einstein was\nthe \frst to state it clearly and hammer out all the coun-\nterintuitive consequences. In this Chapter the concept of\na \\principle of relativity\" is introduced, Einstein's is pre-\nsented, and some of the experimental evidence prompting\nit is discussed.\n1.1 What is a principle of relativity?\nThe \frst principle of relativity ever proposed is attributed\nto Galileo, although he probably did not formulate it pre-\ncisely. Galileo's principle of relativity says that sailors on\na uniformly moving boat cannot, by performing on-board\nexperiments, determine the boat's speed. They can de-\ntermine the speed by looking at the relative movement of\nthe shore, by dragging something in the water, or by mea-\nsuring the strength of the wind, but there is no way they\ncan determine it without observing the world outside the\nboat. A sailor locked in a windowless room cannot even\ntell whether the ship is sailing or docked\u0003.\nThis is a principle of relativity, because it states that\nthere are no observational consequences of absolute mo-\ntion. One can only measure one's velocity relative to\nsomething else.\nAs physicists we are empiricists: we reject as meaning-\nless any concept which has no observable consequences,\nso we conclude that there is no such thing as \\absolute\nmotion.\" Objects have velocities only with respect to\none another. Any statement of an object's speed must be\nmade with respect to something else.\nOur language is misleading because we often give\nspeeds with no reference object. For example, a police\no\u000ecer might say to you \\Excuse me, but do you realize\nthat you were driving at 85 miles per hour?\" The o\u000ecer\n\u0003The sailor is not allowed to use some characteristic rocking or\ncreaking of the boat caused by its motion through the water. That\nis cheating and anyway it is possible to make a boat which has no\nsuch property on a calm sea\nleaves out the phrase \\with respect to the Earth,\" but it\nis there implicitly. In other words, you cannot contest a\nspeeding ticket on the strength of Galileo'sprinciple since\nit is implicit in the law that the speed is to be measured\nwith respect to the road.\nWhen Kepler \frst introduced a heliocentric model of\nthe Solar System, it was resisted on the grounds of com-\nmon sense. If the Earth is orbiting the Sun, why can't we\n\\feel\" the motion? Relativity provides the answer: there\nare no local, observational consequences to our motion.y\nNow that the Earth's motion is generally accepted, it has\nbecome the best evidence we have for Galilean relativity.\nOn a day-to-day basis we are not aware of the motion of\nthe Earth around the Sun, despite the fact that its orbital\nspeed is a whopping 30 kms−1 (100;000 kmh−1). We are\nalso not aware of the Sun's 220 kms−1 motion around\nthe center of the Galaxy (e.g., Binney & Tremaine 1987,\nChapter 1) or the roughly 600 kms−1 motion of the local\ngroup of galaxies (which includes the Milky Way) rela-\ntive to the rest frame of the cosmic background radiation\n(e.g., Peebles 1993, Section 6). We have become aware\nof these motions only by observing extraterrestrial refer-\nences (in the above cases, the Sun, the Galaxy, and the\ncosmic background radiation). Our everyday experience\nis consistent with a stationary Earth.\n\u000f Problem 1{1: You are driving at a steady\n100 kmh−1. At noon you pass a parked police car. At\ntwenty minutes past noon, the police car passes you, trav-\nellingat 120 kmh−1. (a) How fast is the police car moving\nrelative to you? (b) When did the police car start driving,\nassuming that it accelerated from rest to 120 kmh−1 in-\nstantaneously? (c) How far away from you was the police\ncar when it started?\n\u000f Problem 1{2: You are walking at 2m s −1 down a\nstraight road, which is aligned with the x-axis. At time\nt =0s you sneeze. At time t =5s a dog barks, and\nat the moment he barks he is x =1 0m ahead of you\nin the road. At time t =1 0s a car which is just then\n15 mb e h i n dy o u( x = −15 m) back\fres. (a) Plot the\nyActually, there are some observational consequences to the\nEarth's rotation (spin): for example, Foucault's pendulum, the ex-\nistence of hurricanes and other rotating windstorms, and the pre-\nferred direction of rotation of draining water. The point here is\nthat there are no consequences to the Earth's linear motion through\nspace.\n12 Chapter 1. Principles of relativity\npositions x and times t of the sneeze, bark and back\fre,\nrelative to you, on a two-dimensional graph. Label the\npoints. (b) Plot positions x0 and times t0 of the sneeze,\nbark and back\fre, relative to an observer standing still, at\nthe position at which you sneezed. Assume your watches\nare synchronized.\n\u000f Problem 1{3: If you throw a superball at speed v\nat a wall, it bounces back with the same speed, in the\nopposite direction. What happens if you throw it at speed\nv towards a wall which is travelling towards you at speed\nw? What is your answer in the limit in which w is much\nlarger than v?\n\u000f Problem 1{4: You are trying to swim directly east\nacross a river ﬂowing south. The river ﬂows at 0:5ms −1\nand you can swim, in still water, at 1m s −1. Clearly if\nyou attempt to swim directly east you will drift down-\nstream relative to the bank of the river. (a) What angle\n\u0012a will your velocity vector relative to the bank make\nwith the easterly direction? (b) What will be your speed\n(magnitude of velocity) va relative to the bank?

(d) When you swim at\nthis angle, what is your speed vc relative to the bank?\n1.2 Einstein's principle of relativity\nEinstein's principle of relativity says, roughly, that every\nphysical law and fundamental physical constant (includ-\ning, in particular, the speed of light in vacuum) is the\nsame for all non-accelerating observers. This principle\nwas motivated by electromagnetic theory and in fact the\n\feld of special relativity was launched by a paper enti-\ntled (in English translation) \\On the electrodynamics of\nmoving bodies\" (Einstein 1905).z Einstein's principle is\nnot di\u000berent from Galileo'sexcept that it explicitly states\nthat electromagnetic experiments (such as measurement\nof the speed of light) will not tell the sailor in the win-\ndowless room whether or not the boat is moving, any\nmore than ﬂuid dynamical or gravitational experiments.\nSince Galileo was thinking of experiments involving bowls\nof soup and cannonballs dropped from towers, Einstein's\nprinciple is e\u000bectively a generalization of Galileo's.\nThe govern-\ning equations of electromagnetism, Maxwell's equations\n(e.g., Purcell 1985), describe the interactions of magnets,\nelectrical charges and currents, as well as light, which is\na disturbance in the electromagnetic \feld. The equations\ndepend on the speed of light c in vacuum; in other words,\nif the speed of light in vacuum was di\u000berent for two di\u000ber-\nent observers, the two observers would be able to tell this\nsimply by performing experiments with magnets, charges\nand currents. Einstein guessed that a very strong princi-\nple of relativity might hold, that is, that the properties\nzThis paper is extremelyreadableand it is stronglyreccomended\nthat the student of relativity read it during a course like this one.\nIt is available in English translation in Lorentz et al. (1923).\nof magnets, charges and currents will be the same for all\nobservers, no matter what their relative velocities. Hence\nthe speed of light must be the same for all observers. Ein-\nstein's guess was forti\fed by some experimental evidence\navailable at the time, to be discussed below, and his prin-\nciple of relativity is now one of the most rigorously tested\nfacts in all of physics, con\frmed directly and indirectly\nin countless experiments.\nThe consequences of this principle are enormous. In\nfact, these notes are devoted to the strange predictions\nand counterintuitive results that follow from it. The most\nobvious and hardest to accept (though it has been exper-\nimentally con\frmed countless times now) is that the fol-\nlowingsimple rule for velocity addition (the rule you must\nhave used to solve the Problems in the previous Section)\nis false:\nConsider a sailor Alejandro (A) sailing past an ob-\nserver Barbara (B) at speed u. If A throws a cantaloupe,\nin the same direction as he is sailing past B, at speed\nv0 relative to himself, B will observe the cantaloupe to\ntravel at speed v = v0+u relative to herself. This rule for\nvelocity addition is wrong. Or imagine that A drops the\ncantaloupe into the water and observes the waves travel-\ning forward from the splash. If B is at rest with respect\nto the water and water waves travel at speed w relative to\nthe water, B will obviously see the waves travel forward\nfrom the splash at speed w. On the other hand A, who\nis moving forward at speed u already, will see the waves\ntravel forward at lower speed w0 = w − u. This rule for\nvelocity addition is also wrong!\nAfter all, instead of throwing a cantaloupe, A could\nhave shined a ﬂashlight. In this case, if we are Galileans\n(that is, if we believe in the above rule for velocity addi-\ntion), there are two possible predictions for the speeds at\nwhich A and B observe the light to travel from the ﬂash-\nlight. If light is made up of particles which are emitted\nfrom their source at speed c relative to the source, then A\nwill observe the light to travel at speed c relative to him-\nself, while B will observe it to travel at c + u relative to\nherself. If, on the other hand, light is made up of waves\nthat travel at c relative to some medium (analogous to\nthe water for water waves), then we would expect A to\nsee the light travel at c−u and B to see it travel at c (as-\nsuming B is at rest with the medium). Things get more\ncomplicated if both A and B are moving relative to the\nmedium, but in almost every case we expect A and B to\nobserve di\u000berent speeds of light if we believe our simple\nrule for velocity addition.\nEinstein's principle requires that A and B observe ex-\nactly the same speed of light, so Einstein and the simple\nrules for velocity addition cannot both be correct. It turns\nout that Einstein is right and the \\obvious\" rules for ve-\nlocity addition are incorrect. In this, as in many things\nwe will encounter, our initial intuition is wrong. We will\ntry to build a new, correct intuition based on Einstein's\nprinciple of relativity.\n\u000f Problem 1{5: (For discussion.) What assumptions\ndoes one naturally make which must be wrong in order for1.3. The Michelson-Morley experiment 3\nA and B to measure the same speed of light in the above\nexample? Consider how speeds are measured: with rulers\nand clocks.\n1.3 The Michelson-Morley experiment\nIn the late nineteenth century, most physicists were con-\nvinced, contra Newton (1730), that light is a wave and not\na particle phenomenon. They were convinced by interfer-\nence experiments whose results can be explained (classi-\ncally) only in the context of wave optics. The fact that\nlight is a wave implied, to the physicists of the nineteenth\ncentury, that there must be a medium in which the waves\npropagate|there must be something to \\wave\"|and the\nspeed of light should be measured relative to thismedium,\ncalled the aether. (If all this is not obvious to you, you\nprobably were not brought up in the scienti\fc atmosphere\nof the nineteenth century!) The Earth orbits the Sun, so\nit cannot be at rest with respect to the medium, at least\nnot on every day of the year, and probably not on any\nday. The motion of the Earth through the aether can\nbe measured with a simple experiment that compares the\nspeed of light in perpendicular directions. This is known\nas the Michelson-Morley experiment and its surprising re-\nsult was a crucial hint forEinstein and his contemporaries\nin developing special relativity.x\nImagine that the hypothesis of the aether is correct,\nthat is, there is a medium in the rest frame of which\nlight travels at speed c, and Einstein's principle of rela-\ntivity does not hold. Imagine further that we are per-\nforming an experiment to measure the speed of light c\b\non the Earth, which is moving at velocity v\b (a vector\nwith magnitude v\b) with respect to this medium. If we\nmeasure the speed of light in the direction parallel to the\nEarth's velocity v\b,w eg e tc\b = c − v\b because the\nEarth is \\chasing\" the light. If we measure the speed of\nlight in the opposite direction|antiparallelto the Earth's\nvelocity|we get c\b = c+v\b. If we measure in the direc-\ntion perpendicular to the motion, we get c\b =\nq\nc2 − v2\n\b\nbecause the speed of light is the hypotenuse of a right\ntriangle with sides of length c\b and v\b.{ If the aether\nhypothesis is correct, these arguments show that the mo-\ntion of the Earth through the aether can be detected with\na laboratory experiment.\nThe Michelson-Morley experiment was designed to\nperform this determination, by comparing directly the\nspeed of light in perpendicular directions. Because it is\nvery di\u000ecult to make a direct measurement of the speed\nof light, the device was very cleverly designed to make an\naccurate relative determination. Light entering the ap-\nparatus from a lamp is split into two at a half-silvered\nmirror. One half of the light bounces back and forth 14\ntimes in one direction and the other half bounces back\nand forth 14 times in the perpendicular direction; the\ntotal distance travelled is about 11 m per beam. The\nxThe information in this section comes from Michelson & Morley\n(1887) and the history of the experiment by Shankland (1964).\n{The demonstration of this is left as an exercise.\ntwo beams are recombined and the interference pattern\nis observed through a telescope at the output. The whole\napparatus is mounted on a stone platform which is ﬂoated\non mercury to stabilize it and allow it to be easily rotated.\nFigure 1.1 shows the apparatus, and Figure 1.2 shows a\nsimpli\fed version.\nFigure 1.1: The Michelson-Morley apparatus (from Michel-\nson & Morley 1887). The light enters the apparatus at a,i s\nsplit by the beam splitter at b, bounces back and forth be-\ntween mirrors d and e, d1 and e1, with mirror e1 adjustable\nto make both paths of equal length, the light is recombined\nagain at b and observed through the telescope at f. A plate\nof glass c compensates, in the direct beam, for the extra\nlight travel time of the reﬂected beam travelling through\nthe beam splitter an extra pair of times. See Figure 1.2 for\na simpli\fed version.\nIf the total length of travel of each beam is ` and one\nbeam is aligned parallel to v\b and the other is aligned\nperpendicular, the travel time in the parallel beam will\nbe\ntk =\n`\n2(c + v\b)\n+\n`\n2(c − v\b)\n=\n`c\nc2 − v2\n\b\n(1.1)\nbecause half the journey is made \\upstream\" and half\n\\downstream.\" In the perpendicular beam,\nt? =\n`\nq\nc2 − v2\n\b\n(1.2)\nbecause the whole journey is made at the perpendicular\nvelocity.

Principles of relativity\nFigure 1.2: The Michelson apparatus (from Kleppner &\nKolenkow 1973), the predecessor to the Michelson-Morley\napparatus (Figure 1.1). The Michelson apparatus shows\nmore clearly the essential principle, although it is less sensi-\ntive than the Michelson-Morley apparatus because the path\nlength is shorter.\nperpendicular beams, is\n\u0001t =\n`\nc\n\"\n1\n1 − \f2 −\n1\np\n1 − \f2\n#\n(1.3)\nFor small x,( 1+x)n \u0019 1+nx,s o\n\u0001t \u0019\n`\n2c\n\f2 (1.4)\nSince the apparatus will be rotated, the device will swing\nfrom having one arm parallel to the motion of the Earth\nand the other perpendicular to having the one perpendic-\nular and the other parallel. So as the device is rotated\nthrough a half turn, the time delay between arms will\nchange by twice the above \u0001t.\nThe lateral position of the interference fringes as mea-\nsured in the telescope is a function of the relative travel\ntimes of the light beams along the two paths. When the\ntravel times are equal, the central fringe lies exactly in the\ncenter of the telescope \feld. If the paths di\u000ber by one-half\na period (one-half a wavelength in distance units), the\nfringes shift by one-half of the fringe separation, which\nis well resolved in the telescope. As the apparatus is\nrotated with respect to the Earth's motion through the\naether, the relative travel times of the light along the two\npaths was expected to change by 0:4 periods, because (in\nthe aether model) the speed of light depends on direc-\ntion. The expected shift of the interference fringes was\n0:4 fringe spacings, but no shift at all was observed as\nthe experimenters rotated the apparatus. Michelson and\nMorley were therefore able to place upper limits on the\nspeed of the Earth v\b through the aether; the upper lim-\nits were much lower than the expected speed simply due\nto the Earth's orbit around the Sun (let alone the Sun's\norbit around the Galaxy and the Galaxy's motion among\nits neighboring galaxies).\nMichelson and Morley concluded that something was\nwrong with the standard aether theory; for instance, per-\nhaps the Earth drags its local aether along with it, so\nwe are always immersed in locally stationary aether. In\na famous paper, Lorentz (1904) proposed that all mov-\ning bodies are contracted along the direction of their mo-\ntion by the amount exactly necessary for the Michelson-\nMorley result to be null. Both these ideas seemed too\nmuch like \\\fne-tuning\" a so-far unsubstatiated theory.\nEinstein's explanation|that there is no aether and\nthat the speed of light is the same for all observers\n(and in all directions)|is the explanation that won out\neventually.k The Michelson-Morley experiment was an\nattempt by \\sailors\" (Michelson and Morley) to deter-\nmine the speed of their \\boat\" (the Earth) without look-\ning out the window or comparing to some other object, so\naccording to the principle of relativity, they were doomed\nto failure.\n\u000f Problem 1{6: With perfect mirrors and light source,\nthe Michelson-Morley apparatus can be made more sen-\nsitive by making the path lengths longer. Why is a de-\nvice with longer paths more sensitive? The paths can be\nlengthened by making the platform larger or adding more\nmirrors (see Figure 1.1). In what ways would such modi-\n\fcation also degrade the performance of the device given\nimperfect mirrors and light source (and other real-world\nconcerns)? Discuss the pros and cons of such modi\fca-\ntions.\n\u000f Problem 1{7: Show that under the hypothesis of a\nstationary aether, the speed of light as observed from a\nplatform moving at speed v, in the direction perpendicu-\nlar to the platform's motion, is\np\nc2 − v2. For a greater\nchallenge: what is the observed speed for an arbitrary an-\ngle \u0012 between the direction of motion and the direction in\nwhich the speed of light is measured? Your answer should\nreduce to c + v and c − v for \u0012 =0and \u0019.\nIt is worthy of note that when Michelson and Morley\n\frst designed their experiment and predicted the fringe\nshift, they did not realize that the speed of light perpen-\ndicular to the direction of motion of the platform would\nbe other than c. This correction was pointed out to them\nby Potier in 1881 (Michelson & Morley, 1887).\nkIt was also Poincar\u0013 e's (1900) explanation. Forshadowing Ein-\nstein, he said that the Michelson-Morley experiment shows that\nabsolute motion cannot be detected to second order in v=c and so\nperhaps it cannot be detected to any order. Poincar\u0013 e is also al-\nlegedly the \frst person to have named this proposal a \\principle of\nrelativity.\"1.4. The \\specialness\" of special relativity 5\n1.4 The \\specialness\" of special relativity\nWhy is this subject called \\special relativity,\" and not\njust \\relativity\"? It is because the predictions we make\nonly strictly hold in certain special situations.\nSome of the thought experiments (and real experi-\nments) described in these notes take place on the surface\nof the Earth, and we will assume that the gravitational\n\feld of the Earth (and all other planets and stars) is\nnegligible.\u0003\u0003 The laws of special relativity strictly hold\nonly in a \\freely falling\" reference frame in which the ob-\nservers experience no gravity. The laws strictly hold when\nwe are falling towards the Earth (as in a broken elevator;\ne.g., Frautschi et al., 1986, ch. 9) or orbiting around the\nEarth (as in the Space Shuttle; ibid.), but not when we\nare standing on it.\nDoes the gravitational \feld of the Sun a\u000bect our re-\nsults? No, because we are orbiting the Sun. The Earth\nis in a type of \\free fall\" around the Sun. Does the ro-\ntation of the Earth a\u000bect our results? Yes, because the\ncentrifugal force that is felt at the equator is equivalent\nto an outward gravitational force. However, this e\u000bect is\nmuch smaller than the Earth's gravity, so it is even more\nnegligible.\nIn addition, we are going to assume that all light sig-\nnals are travelling in vacuum. The speed of light in air\nis actually a bit less than the speed of light in vacuum.\nWe will neglect this di\u000berence. The \\c\"t h a tc o m e si n t o\nthe general equations that we will derive is the speed of\nlight in vacuum, no matter what the speed at which light\nis actually travelling in the local medium. Everything is\nsimpler if we just treat all our experiments as if they are\noccurring in vacuum.\n\u000f Problem 1{8: (Library excercise.) How much slower\n(or faster) is the speed of light in air, relative to vacuum?\nHow do you think the speed will depend on temperature\nand pressure? How much slower (or faster) is the speed\nof light in glass and water, relative to vacuum. Give your\nreferences.\n\u000f Problem 1{9: You shine a ﬂashlight from one end\nzone of a football \feld to a friend standing in the other\nend zone. Because of the Earth's gravity, the beam of\nlight will be pulled downwards as it travels across the\n\feld. Estimate, any way you can, the distance the light\nwill \\drop\" vertically as it travels across the \feld. What\ndeﬂection angle does this correspond to, in arcseconds?\nDon't worry about getting a precise answer, just esti-\nmate the order of magnitude of the e\u000bect.\n\u0003\u0003The fractional error that the Earth's gravity introducesinto the\nexperiments we describe must depend only on the acceleration due\nto gravity g, the parameters of each experiment, and fundamental\nconstants. Fractional error is dimensionless, and the most obvious\nfundamental constant to use is c.T h e r a t i o g=c has dimensions\nof inverse time. This suggests that an experiment which has a\ncharacteristic time \u001c or length ` will not agree with the predictions\nof special relativity to better than a fractional error of about \u001cg = c\nor `g=c 2 if it is performed on the surface of the Earth.6 Chapter 1. Principles of relativityChapter 2\nTime dilation and length contraction\nThis Chapter is intended to demonstrate the simplic-\nity of special relativity. With one basic thought exper-\niment the two most important e\u000bects predicted by the\ntheory are derived: time dilation and length contraction.\nFor the beginning student of relativity, this is the most\nimportant chapter.\nIt is emphasized that the predicted e\u000bects are real,\nnot just apparent.\nBefore starting, recall Einstein's (1905) principle of\nrelativity (hereafter \\the\" principle of relativity): there\nis no preferred reference frame; no entirely on-board ex-\nperiment can tell a sailor the speed of her or his boat. Its\n\frst consequence is that the speed of light is the same in\nall frames.\n2.1 Time dilation\nConsider two observers, Deepto (D) and Erika (E), mov-\ning relative to one another in spaceships. D measures E's\nspeed to be u with respect to D's rest frame. By symme-\ntry, E must also measure D's speed to be u with respect\nto E's rest frame. If this is not obvious to you, notice that\nthere is no absolute di\u000berence between D and E. If they\ndid not measure the same speed, which one of them would\nmeasure a higher speed? In order for one to measure a\nhigher speed, one of them would have to be in a special\nor \\preferred\" frame; the principle of relativity precludes\nthis.\nNow imagine that D and E each carry a clock of a\ncertain very strange type. These \\light-clocks\" consist\nof an evacuated glass tube containing a lightbulb, a mir-\nror, a photodetector and some electrical equipment. The\nphotodetector is right next to the lightbulb (but sepa-\nrated by a light-blocking shield) and the mirror is 0.5 m\nfrom the lightbulb (see Figure 2.1). When the clock is\nstarted, the lightbulb ﬂashes, light bounces o\u000b the mirror\nand back into the photodetector. When the photodetec-\ntor registers the light, it immediately signals the lightbulb\nto ﬂash again. Every time the photodetector registers a\nlight pulse, it ﬂashes the bulb again.\nThe round-trip distance for the light inside the light-\nclock is 1 m and the speed of light c is roughly 3 \u0002\n108 ms −1, so the round-trip time for the light is roughly\n3:3\u0002 10−9 s. The clock ticks o\u000b time in 3:3 ns (nanosec-\nond) intervals. The speed of light is the same for all\nlightbulb\nshield\nphotodetector\nevacuated tube\nmirror\n0.5 m\nFigure 2.1: The schematic layout of a light-clock. The\nround-trip distance (lightbulb to mirror to photodetector)\nfor the light is 1 m.\nobservers, so c can be seen as a conversion factor between\ntime and distance. Under this interpretation, the clock\nticks o\u000b time in meters!\u0003\nImaginethat D holdshis light-clock so that the light is\nbouncing back and forth at right angles to his direction of\nmotion with respect to E. D observes the light ﬂashes in\nhis clock to make 1 m round trips in \u0001t =3 :3n si n t e r v a l s .\nWhat does E observe? Recall that D is moving at speed\nu with respect to E, so in E's rest frame the light in D's\nclock is not really making round trips. As it travels down\nthe tube and back, D is advancing in the perpendicular\ndirection; the light takes a zig-zag path which is longer\nthan the straight back-and-forth path (see Figure 2.2).\nBy the principle of relativity, E and D must observe the\nsame speed of light, so we are forced to conclude that\nE will measurey longer time intervals \u0001t0 between the\nﬂashes in D's clock than D will. (In this chapter, all\nquantities that E measures will be primed and all that\nD measures will be unprimed.)

Using these new symbols, \u0001t0 = γ \u0001t.\nAbove we found that \\movingclocks go slow,\" but one\nmight object that we have shown only that these strange\nlight-clocksgo slow. However, we can show that all clocks\nare subject to the same time dilation. Suppose that in ad-\ndition to his light-clock, D also has a wristwatch that ticks\nevery 3:3 ns, and suppose (incorrectly) that this watch is\nnot subject to time dilation; i.e., suppose that E observes\nthe watch to tick with intervals of 3:3n sn om a t t e rw h a t\nD's speed. When D is not moving with respect to E the\nwristwatch and light-clocktick at the same rate, but when\nD is moving at high speed, they tick at di\u000berent rates be-\ncause, by supposition, one is time-dilated and the other\nis not. D could use the relative tick rates of the watch\nand clock to determine his speed, and thereby violate the\nprinciple of relativity. It is left to the ambitious reader to\nprove that it is not possible for D to observe both time-\npieces to tick at the same rate while E observes them to\ntick at di\u000berent rates.\nThe reader might object that we have already vio-\nlated relativity: if D and E are in symmetric situations,\nhow come E measures longer time intervals?

In-\ndeed this is true; after all, all of the above arguments are\nequally applicable if we swap D and E. This is the fun-\ndamentally counterintuitive aspect of relativity. How it\ncan be that both observers measure slower rates on the\nother's clock? The fact is, there is no contradiction, as\nlong as we are willing to give up on a concept of abso-\nlute time, agreed-upon by all observers.

As much as possible, the term \\to observe\" will be\nused to mean \\to measure a real e\u000bect with a correct ex-\nperimental technique,\" while \\to see\" will be reserved for\napparent e\u000bects, or phenomena which relate to the fact\nthat we look from a particular viewpoint with a partic-\nular pair of eyes. This means that we won't talk about\nwhat is \\seen\" in detail until Chapter 7.\nThough E observes D's clock to run slow, what she\nsees can be quite di\u000berent. The time intervals between\nthe ﬂashes of D's clock that she sees depends on the time\ndilation and the changing path lengths that the light tra-2.3. Length contraction 9\nverses in getting to E. The path lengths are changing be-\ncause D is moving with respect to E (see Figure 2.3). In\norder to correctly measure the rate of D's clock, E must\nsubtract the light-travel time of each pulse (which she\ncan compute by comparing the direction from which the\nlight comes with the trajectory that was agreed upon in\nadvance). It is only when she subtracts these time delays\nthat she measures the time between ticks correctly, and\nwhen she does this, she will \fnd that the time between\nt i c k si si n d e e d\u0001 t0, the dilated time.\nF\nF\nF\nF\nD\n4\nE\nS\nS\nS\nS\n1\n1\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\nFigure 2.3: Observing the time delay.

Hence di\u000berent ﬂashes take di\u000berent times\nto get to E. E must correct for this before making any state-\nments about time dilation. It is after the correction is made\nthat E observes the predicted time dilation.\n\u000f Problem 2{6: Consider a clock, which when at rest\nproduces a ﬂash of light every second, moving away from\nyou at (4=5)c. (a) How frequently does it ﬂash when\nit is moving at (4=5)c? (b) By how much does dis-\ntance between you and the clock increase between ﬂashes?\n(c) How much longer does it take each ﬂash to get to your\neye than the previous one? (d) What, therefore, is the in-\nterval between the ﬂashes you see?\nYou will \fnd that the time interval between the ﬂashes\nyou see is much longer than merely what time-dilation\npredicts, because successive ﬂashes come from further and\nfurther away. This e\u000bect is known as the Doppler shift\nand is covered in much more detail in Chapter 7\n2.3 Length contraction\nImagine that E observes D's clock to tick 100 times during\na journey from planet A to planet B, two planets at rest\nin E's rest frame.\nD must also observe 100 ticks during this same jour-\nney. After all, if we imagine that the clock punches a\ntime card each time it ticks and D inserts the time card\nat point A and removes it at point B, it must have been\npunched a de\fnite number of times when it is removed. D\nand E must agree on this number, because, for example,\nthey can meet later and examine the card.\nIn addition to agreeing on the number of ticks, D and\nE also agree on their relative speed. (They must, because\nthere is total symmetry between them: if one measured\na larger speed, which one could it be?) However, they\ndo not agree on the rate at which D's clock ticks. While\nE measures the distance between A and B to be `0 =\n100u\u0001t0,Dm e a s u r e si tt ob e` = 100u\u0001t = `0=γ.S i n c e\nγ>1, D measures a shorter distance than E. D is moving\nrelative to the planets A and B, while E is stationary.\nPlanets A and B can be thought of as being at the ends\nof a ruler stick which E is holding, a ruler stick which is\nmoving with respect to D. We conclude that moving ruler\nsticks are shortened; this e\u000bect is length contraction, or\nsometimes Lorentz contraction.\nIt is simple to show that length contraction acts only\nparallel to the direction of motion. Imagine that both\nE and D are carrying identical pipes, aligned with the\ndirection of their relative motion (see Figure 2.4). Let\nFigure 2.4: E and D carrying pipes to prove that there can be\nno length changes perpendicular to the direction of motion.\nus assume (incorrectly) that the large relative velocity\ncauses the diameter of E's pipe to contract in D's frame.\nIf this happens, D's pipe becomes larger than E's pipe,\nso E's pipe \\\fts inside\" D's pipe. But E and D are in-\nterchangeable, so D's pipe contracts in E's frame and D's\npipe \fts inside E's. Clearly it cannot be that both D's\n\fts inside E's and E's \fts inside D's, so there is a contra-\ndiction; there can be no length changes perpendicular to\nthe direction of relative motion.\nNote that because there are no length changes per-\npendicular to the direction of motion, we cannot explain\naway time dilation and length contraction with length\nchanges in the light-clock perpendicular to the direction\nof motion.\n\u000f Problem 2{7: How fast do you have to throw a meter\nstick to make it one-third its rest length?\n\u000f Problem 2{8: Two spaceships, each measuring\n100 m in its own rest frame, pass by each other traveling\nin opposite directions. Instruments on board spaceship A\ndetermine that the front of spaceship B requires 5\u000210−6 s\nto traverse the full length of A. (a) What is the relative\nvelocity v of the two spaceships? (b) How much time\nelapses on a clock on spaceship B as it traverses the full\nlength of A? (From French 1966.)\n\u000f Problem 2{9: That there can be no length con-\ntraction perpendicular to the direction of motion is often\ndemonstrated with the example of a train and its track;10 Chapter 2. Time dilation and length contraction\ni.e., if there were length changes perpendicular the train\nwould no longer \ft on the track. Make this argument,\nand in particular, explain why the train must \ft on the\ntrack no matter how fast it is going.\n2.4 Magnitude of the e\u000bects\nAs these example problems show, the e\u000bects of time di-\nlation and length contraction are extremely small in ev-\neryday life, but large for high-energy particles and any\npractical means of interstellar travel.\n\u000f Problem 2{10: In the rest frame of the Earth, the\ndistance ` between New York and Los Angeles is roughly\n4000 km.

If, as experimental-\nists, we need a sample of muons to have a longer mean\nlife of T0 =1 1\u0016s, to what speed u must we accelerate\nthem? What distance `, on average, does one of these\nhigh-speed muons travel before decaying?\nWe want the muons to age at 1=5 their usual rate, so\nwe want time dilation by a factor γ = 5. Inverting the\nformula for γ we \fnd\n\f =\nr\n1 −\n1\nγ2 (2.6)\nor in this case \f =2 4 =25. This makes u =2 4 c=25 and\n` = uT = 630 m.\n\u000f Problem 2{12: Alpha Centauri is a distance of ` =\n4:34 light years (one light year is the distance light travels\nin one year) from the Earth.

By how much will the\nastronaut's siblings age over the same time?\nThisisthe famous\\twinparadox,\" which we willcover\nin gory detail in Section 4.5. For now, let us be simplistic\nand answer the questions without thinking.\nWe want the elapsed time T0 in the astronaut's frame\nto be 20 years as he or she goes a distance 2`0, the dis-\ntance from the Earth to Alpha Centauri and back in the\nastronaut's frame. The time and distance are related by\nT0 =2 `0=u =2 `=(γu). So we need γu =2 `=T 0.

So the\nastronaut must travel at u =0 :398c, and from the point\nof view of the siblings, the trip takes T =2 `=u =2 1 :8y r .\n2.5 Experimental con\frmation\nAs we have seen in the previous section, the e\u000bects of time\ndilation and length contraction are not very big in our ev-\neryday experience. However, these predictions of special\nrelativity have been con\frmed experimentally. Timedila-\ntion is generally easier to con\frm directly because Nature\nprovides us with an abundance of moving clocks, and be-\ncause in such experiments, it is generally more straight-\nforward to design procedures in which the delays from\nlight travel time (discussed in Section 2.2) are not impor-\ntant. Of course in addition to experiments like the one\ndiscussed in this section, both time dilation and length\ncontraction are con\frmed indirectly countless times ev-\nery day in high energy physics experiments around the\nworld.\nThe \frst direct con\frmation of time dilation was ob-\ntained by Bruno Rossi and David Hall, studying the\ndecay of muons (in those days called \\mesotrons\" or\n\\mu mesons\") as they descend through the Earth's\natmosphere.z Muons are elementary particlesx produced\nat high altitude when cosmic rays (fast-moving pro-\ntons and other atomic nuclei) collide with atoms in the\nEarth's atmosphere. When produced more or less at\nrest in the laboratory, each muon has a mean lifetime\nof \u001c0 =2 :5 \u0002 10−6 seconds before it disintegrates. In-\ndeed, if one has N0 muons at time zero and then looks at\nal a t e rt i m et, the number of muons will have dropped\nto N(t)=N0 e−t=\u001c0. If there were no such thing as\ntime dilation, the mean distance a muon moving at high\nspeed v = \fc could travel before disintegrating would be\nL = v\u001c0. Similarly if at position zero one has N0 muons\nmoving at speed v down a tube, at a position x further\nzThe informationin this section comes from Rossi & Hall (1941),\ntheir extremely readable, original paper.\nxFor those who care, muons are leptons, most analogous to elec-\ntrons, with the same charge but considerably more mass. They are\nunstable and typically decay into electrons and neutrinos.2.5. Experimental con\frmation 11\ndown the tube there would be only N(x)=N0 e−x=L.\nAs the speed of the muons approaches c, the mean range\nwould approach c\u001c0, or 750 m. Since the muons are cre-\nated at high altitude, very few of them could reach the\nground.\nHowever, we expect that time dilation does occur, and\nso the mean life \u001c and range L of the moving muons\nwill be increased by the Lorentz factor γ \u0011 (1 − \f2)−1=2\nto \u001c = γ\u001c 0 and L = γv\u001c 0. Although all the muons\nwill be moving at speeds close to c (\f nearly 1), they\nwill have di\u000berent particular values of γ and therefore\ndecay with di\u000berent mean ranges. Bruno & Rossi mea-\nsure the ﬂuxes (number of muons falling on a detector\nof a certain area per minute) of muons of two di\u000berent\nkinetic energies at observing stations in Denver and Echo\nLake, Colorado, separated in altitude by \u0001h = 1624 m\n(Denver below Echo Lake). The higher-energy muons in\ntheir experiment have Lorentz factor γ1 \u0019 18:8 (speed\nv1 \u0019 0:9986c)while the lower-energy muons have γ2 \u0019 6:3\n(v2 \u0019 0:987c). Because we expect the mean range L\no fam u o nt ob eL = γv\u001c 0,w ee x p e c tt h er a t i oo f\nranges L1=L2 for the two populations of muons to be\n(γ1 v1)=(γ2 v2) \u0019 3:0. The ﬂux of higher-energy muons\nat Denver is lower by a factor of 0:883 \u0006 0:005 than it\nis at Echo Lake, meaning that if they have mean range\nL1, e−\u0001h=L1 =0 :883. The ﬂux of lower-energy muons de-\ncreases by a factor of 0:698\u0006 0:002, so e−\u0001h=L2 =0 :698.\nTaking logarithms and ratios, we \fnd that L1=L2 =2 :89\nas predicted. The results do not make sense if the time\ndilation factor (the Lorentz factor) is ignored.\n\u000f Problem 2{13: Consider a muon traveling straight\ndown towards the surface of the Earth at Lorentz fac-\ntor γ1 \u0019 18:8. (a) What is the vertical distance between\nDenver and Echo Lake, according to the muon? (b) How\nlong does it take the muon to traverse this distance, ac-\ncording to the muon?

They\ndecay in their own rest frame according to the law\nN(t)=N0 2−t=T (2.8)\nwhere T =2\u0002 10−8 s is the half-life. A burst of pions is\nproduced at the target of an accelerator and it is observed\nthat two-thirds of them survive at a distance of 30 m from\nthe target. At what γ value are the pions moving?

It is observed that 1000\ncounts are recorded in the \frst counter and 250 in the\nsecond. Assuming that this whole decrease is due to de-\ncay of the particles in ﬂight, what is their half-life as it\nwouldbe measured in their own rest frame? (From French\n1966.)12 Chapter 2. Time dilation and length contractionChapter 3\nThe geometry of spacetime\nObservers in di\u000berent frames of reference, even if they\nare observing identical events, may observe very di\u000ber-\nent relationships between those events. For example, two\nevents which are simultaneousfor one observer will not, in\ngeneral, be simultaneous for another observer. However,\nthe principle of relativity must hold, i.e., both observers\nmust agree on all laws of physics and in particular on the\nspeed of light. This principle allows detailed construction\nof the di\u000berences between two observers' measurements\nas a function of their relative velocity. In this chapter we\nderive some of these relationships using a very useful tool:\nthe spacetime diagram. With spacetime diagrams most\nspecial relativity problems are reduced to simple geome-\ntry problems. The geometric approach is the most elegant\nmethod of solving special relativity problems and it is also\nthe most robust because it requires the problem-solver to\nvisualize the relationships between events and worldlines.\n3.1 Spacetime diagrams\nFrances (F) and Gregory (G) live on planets A and B,\nrespectively, separated in space by ` =6\u0002 1011 m (600\nmillion km). Exactly halfway between their home plan-\nets, on the line joining them, is an interplanetary caf\u0013 e( C ) ,\nat which they decide to meet at noon. F has a standard-\nmodel spaceship which travels at speed c=5( w h i c hc o r -\nresponds to \f =1 =5), while G's sporty model travels at\nc=3( \f =1 =3). If we choose a coordinate system with\nthe x-axis pointing along the direction from A to B, we\ncan plot the trajectories, or worldlines, of F and G on a\ndiagram with distance x on the abscissa and time t on the\nordinate. Actually, to emphasize the geometry of special\nrelativity, we will use not t to mark time, but ct,w h i c h\nhas dimensions of distance.\u0003 Such a plot, as in Figure 3.1,\nis a spacetime diagram. Figure 3.1 is clearly drawn in the\nrest frame of planets A and B: the planet worldlines are\nvertical; the planets do not change position with time.\nThey meet at noon at the caf\u0013 e. Their meeting is an\nevent: it takes place in a certain location, at a certain\ntime. Anything that has both a position and a time is\nan event. For example, the signing of the United States'\nDeclaration of Independence was an event: it took place\non 4 July, 1776, and it took place in Philadelphia, Penn-\n\u0003Recall the idea, from Section 2.1, that c is merely a conversion\nfactor between time and distance.\nsylvania. Each tick of a clock is an event: it happens at a\ngiven time at the location of the clock. Events are 3+1-\ndimensionaly points|they have three spatial coordinates\nand one time coordinate. In the case of the meeting M\nat the caf\u0013 e of F and G, we needed only 1+1 dimensions\nto specify it because we began by restricting all activity\nto the x-axis, but in general 3+1 dimensions are needed.\nOn Figure 3.1, event M is marked, along with two other\nevents K and L, the departures of F and G.\nBecause we are marking time in dimensions of distance\nct, the inverse slope \u0001x=(c\u0001t) of a worldlineat some time\nct is the speed of the corresponding object in units of c,\nor in other words, \f. As we will see below, nothing can\ntravel faster than the speed of light. So, all worldlines\nmust be steeper than 45\u000e on the spacetime diagram, ex-\ncept, of course, for the worldlines of ﬂashes of light or\nphotons, which have exactly 45\u000e worldlines. Radio, in-\nfrared, optical, ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma-ray signals\nall travel on 45\u000e worldlines maybe neutrinos do tooz.\n\u000f Problem 3{1: The next day F decides to meet G at\nthe caf\u0013 e again, but realizes that she did not arrange this\nwith G in advance. She decides to send a radio message\nthat will get to G at exactly the time he should depart.\nWhen should F send this message?\nWe can answer this problem trivially by looking at\nthe spacetime diagram. If we drop a 45\u000e line from event\nL, G's departure, going back in time towards planet A,\nwe can \fnd the event at which it intersects F's world-\nline. This is done in Figure 3.2; we see that it intersects\nF's worldline exactly at event K, the time of her depar-\nture. This means that F should send the radio message\nat exactly the time she departs for the caf\u0013 e.\n3.2 Boosting: changing reference frames\nHeather (H) and Juan (J) are two more residents of plan-\nets A and B respectively. (A and B are separated by\n` =6\u0002 1011 mi nt h ex-direction.) Early in the morning\n(at event P) H sends J a radio message. At event Q,J\nreceives the message. A time \u001c later in the day, H sends J\nyOne could say \\4-dimensional,\" but it is customary among rel-\nativists to separate the numbers of space and time dimensions by a\nplus sign. The reason for this will be touched upon later.\nzAs we will see in Chapter 6, neutrinos travel at the speed of\nlight only if they are massless; this is currently a subject of debate.\n1314 Chapter 3.

The\ndiagram is drawn in what we will call \\H's frame\" or \\H's\nrest frame,\" because it is a reference frame in which H is\nat rest.\nWhile this is all going on, Keiko (K) is travelling at\nspeed u between planets A and B. How do we re-draw\nthe spacetime diagram in K's frame, a reference frame in\nwhich K is at rest? First of all, K is moving at speed\nu relative to H and J, so in K's frame H and J will be\nmoving at speed −u. Thus, H's and J's worldlines in K's\nframe will have equal but opposite slope to that of K's\nworldline in H's frame. Time dilation (Section 2.1) says\nthat moving clocks go slow, so in K's frame, events P\nand R will be separated in time not by \u001c but by \u0001t0 =\nγ\u001c. Same for Q and S. (All quantities in K's frame will\nbe primed.) Length contraction (Section 2.3) says that\nmoving ruler sticks are shortened. This means that the\ndistance separating the parallel worldlines of two objects\nmoving at the same speed (the \\ends of the ruler stick\") is\nshorter by a factor 1=γ in a frame moving at speed u than\nit is in the frame at which the two objects are at rest. H\nand J, therefore, are separated by not ` but \u0001x0 = `=γ in\nthe horizontal direction.

Thus, the\nspacetime diagram in K's frame must be that pictured in\nFigure 3.4.\nThe transformation from H's frame to K's is a boost\ntransformation because it involves changing velocity. The\nboost transformation is central to special relativity; it is\nthe subject of this and the next chapter.\n\u000f Problem 3{2: Re-draw the events and worldlines of\nFigures 3.3 and 3.4 from the point of view of an observer\nmoving at the same speed as K relative to H and J but\nin the opposite direction.\n\u000f Problem 3{3: Ar o c k e ts h i po fp r o p e rl e n g t h`0 trav-\nels at constant speed v in the x-direction relative to a\nframe S.

They want to put the ladder\ninto the barn, but of course it is too long. N suggests\nthat P run with the ladder at speed u =0 :866c.A tt h i s\nspeed γ = 2, so the ladder will be shortened by enough\nto \ft into the barn. P objects. P argues that if he is\nrunning with the ladder, in his frame the ladder will still\nhave length 2` while the barn will be shortened to length\n`=2. The running plan will only make the problem worse!\nThey cannot both be right. Imagine P running with\nthe ladder through the front door of the barn and out\nthe back door, and imagine that the barn is specially\nequipped with a front door that closes immediately when\nthe back of the ladder enters the barn (event C), and a\nback door that opens immediately when the front of the\nladder reaches it (event D). Either there is a time when\nboth doors are closed and the ladder is enclosed by the\nbarn, or there is not. If there is such a time, we will say\nthat the ladder \fts, and if there is not, we will say that\nit does not \ft. Who is right? Is N right that the ladder\nP\nx\nct\nl g\nH\nJ\nS\ngt\nQ gt\nR\nFigure 3.4: Spacetime diagram with worldlines of H, J, and\nthe radio messages along with the sending and receiving\nevents, now drawn in K's rest frame.

In P's frame, strangely enough, the events are no\nlonger simultaneous! Event D happens long before event\nC, so there is no time at which the ladder is entirely inside\nthe barn. So indeed both N and P are correct: whether or\nnot the ladder \fts inside the barn is a frame-dependent\nquestion; it depends on whether or not two events are\nsimultaneous, and simultaneity is relative.16 Chapter 3.

In fact, the horizontal lines can be drawn in;\nthey are lines of simultaneity.\nNow consider a new frame S0 which is moving at speed\n+u = \fcin the x-direction with respect to S.I nt h i sn e w\nframe, the worldlines of the clocks are no longer vertical\nbecause they are moving at speed −u, but by Einstein's\nprinciple of relativity the ﬂashes of light must still travel\non 45\u000e worldlines. So the spacetime diagram in S0 looks\nlike Figure 3.7. Note that in S0 the lines of simultaneity\njoining the corresponding ticks of the two clocks are no\nlonger horizontal. What does this mean? It means that\ntwo events which are simultaneous in S will not in general\nbe simultaneous in S0.\n3.5 The boost transformation\nWe have seen in the previous section that \\horizontal\"\nlines of simultaneity in one frame become \\tilted\" in an-\nother frame moving with respect to the \frst, but can we\nquantify this? We can, and it turns out that the lines\nof simultaneity in frame S acquire slope −\f in frame S0\n(which moves at speed +\fcwith respect to S) just as the\nlines of constant position in S acquire slope −1=\f in S0.\nx\nct\nF\nG\nH\nFigure 3.7: The clocks as observed in frame S0 along with\nevents F, G, H, and the subsequent ticks. Although the\nclocks are synchronized in S they are not in S0.N o t et h a t\nthe lines of simultaneity (horizontal in S) are slanted in S0.\nA simple thought experiment to demonstrate this consists\nof two clocks, synchronized and at rest in S, exchanging\nphotons simultaneously in S, as shown in Figure 3.8. In\nE\nB A\nC\nD\nFigure 3.8: Clocks at rest and synchronized in frame S ex-\nchanging photons.

So the spacetime diagram in S0 must look like\nFigure 3.9, with the square ABED in S sheared into a\nparallelogram, preserving the diagonals as 45\u000e lines. We\nknow that the slope of the lines of constant position trans-\nform to lines of slope −1=\f; in order to have the diagonals\nbe 45\u000e lines, we need the lines of simultaneity to trans-\nform to lines of slope −\f.\nThis is really the essence of the boost transforma-\ntion, the transformation from one frame to another mov-\ning with respect to it: the transformation is a shear or3.6.

A shear is a linear transfor-\nmation that does not involve rotation, but \\squashes\"\ncoordinates along one direction, allowing them to expand\nalong the perpendicular direction. In this case, these di-\nrections are photon trajectories or 45\u000e worldlines.x We\nwill derive the symbolic form of the boost transformation\nin Chapter 4, but for now these geometrical facts are all\nwe need.\n\u000f Problem 3{5: Prove, using whatever you need (in-\ncluding possibly Figures 3.8 and 3.9), that if the clock\nworld lines have slope 1=\f in some frame, the lines of si-\nmultaneity will have slope \f. The shorter the proof, the\nbetter.\n3.6 Transforming space and time axes\nOne extremely useful way of representing the boost trans-\nformation between two frames on spacetime diagrams is\nto plot the space and time axes of both frames on both\ndiagrams. This requires us to utilize two trivial facts:\n(a) the spatial axis of a frame is just the line of simultane-\nity of that frame which passes through the origin event\n(x;ct)=( 0 ;0) and (b) the time axis is just the line of con-\nstant position which passes through (0;0). So if we (arbi-\ntrarily) identify origin events in the two frames,{ we can\nplot, in frame S0, in addition to the x0 and ct0 axes, the\nlocations of the x and ct axes of frame S (Figure 3.10(a)).\nW ec a na l s op l o tb o t hs e t so fa x e si nf r a m eS.T h i s r e -\nquires boosting not by speed +\fc but rather by −\fc and,\nas you have undoubtedly \fgured out, this slopes the lines\nin the opposite way, and we get Figure 3.10(b). Again\nwe see that the transformation is a shear. Note that the\nboost transformation is not a rotation, at least not in the\ntraditional sense of the word!\nxThe directionsalong which the squash and expansiontake place\nare the eigenvectors of the transformation. The ambitious reader is\ninvited to calculate the two corresponding eigenvalues.\n{The zero of time and space are arbitrary, so, with no loss of gen-\nerality, we can assign these values so that the origin events coincide.\nx\n(a) (b)\nx\nx\nct ct\nct ct\nx\nFigure 3.10: Spacetime diagrams in frames (a) S0 and (b) S,\neach showing the time and space axes of both frames.\nWe are now in a position to answer the question posed\nat the end of Section 2.1: How can it be that two ob-\nservers, moving relative to one another, can both observe\nthe other's clock to tick more slowly than their own?\nImagine that observers at rest in S and S0 both draw\nlines of constant position separated by 1 m of distance\nand lines of simultaneity separated by 1 m of time (3.3 ns)\nthrough the spacetime maps of their frames. In S,t h eS-\nobserver's lines of constant position are vertical, and lines\nof simultaneity are horizontal. The S0-observer's lines of\nconstant position have slope 1=\f and lines of simultaneity\nhave slope −\f, as seen in Figure 3.11. simultaneity. In\nS, the horiztonal distance between the S0-observer's lines\nof constant position is (1 m)=γ. Look carefully at Fig-\nure 3.11, which shows the ticks of each observer's clock\nalong a line of constant position. If we travel along the\nS0-observer's line of constant position, we \fnd that we en-\ncounter ticks of the S0 clock less frequently than lines of\nsimultaneity in S. On the other hand, if we travel along\nthe S-observer's line of constant position, we \fnd that we\nalso encounter ticks of the S clock less freqently than lines\nof simultaneity in S0.T h a ti s ,both observers \fnd that the\nother's clock is going slow. There is no contradiction.\nThis point is subtle enough and important enough\nthat the reader is advised to stare at Figure 3.11 until\nit is understood.18 Chapter 3. The geometry of spacetime\nct\nx\nx\nct\nFigure 3.11: Spacetime diagram in frame S, showing the\nspacetime grids drawn by the observer at rest in S (solid) and\nthe observer at rest in S0 (dotted). The S-observer's clock\nticks with solid dots and the S0-observer's with open dots.\nNote that when travelling along a dotted line of constant\nposition, clock ticks are encountered less frequently than\nsolid lines of simultaneity and when travelling along a solid\nline of constant position, clock ticks are encountered less\nfrequently than dotted lines of simultaneity. This explains\nhow both observers can observe the other's clock to run\nslow.Chapter 4\nThe Lorentz transformation\nIn this Chapter the invariant interval is introduced\nand the Lorentz transformation is derived and discussed.\nThere is a lot of algebra but it is straightforward and the\nresults are simple. The \\twin paradox\" is explained in\nterms of geodesics.\n4.1 Proper time and the invariant interval\nIn 3-dimensional space, two di\u000berent observers can set up\ndi\u000berent coordinate systems, so they will not in general\nassign the same coordinates to a pair of points P1 and P2.\nHowever they will agree on the distance between them.\nIf one observer measures coordinate di\u000berences \u0001x,\u0001 y\nand \u0001z between points A and B, and another, with a\ndi\u000berent coordinate system, measures \u0001x0,\u0001 y0 and \u0001z0,\nthey will both agree on the total distance \u0001r, de\fned by\n(\u0001r)2 \u0011 (\u0001x)2 +( \u0001 y)2 +( \u0001 z)2\n=( \u0001 x0)2 +( \u0001y0)2 +( \u0001 z0)2 : (4.1)\nWewould liketo \fnd a similarquantity forpairs of events:\nsome kind of `length' in 3+1-dimensional spacetime that\nis frame-independent, or the same for all observers. There\nis such a quantity, and it is called the invariant interval\nor simply interval, it is symbolized by (\u0001s)2 and de\fned\nby\n(\u0001s)2 \u0011 (c\u0001t)2 − (\u0001r)2\n\u0011 (c\u0001t)2 − (\u0001x)2 − (\u0001y)2 − (\u0001z)2 ;(4.2)\nwhere \u0001t is the di\u000berence in time between the events, and\n\u0001r is the di\u000berence in space or the distance between the\nplaces of occurence of the events.\nTo demonstrate this, recall Section 2.1 in which we\nconsidered the ﬂashes of a lightclock carried by D. In D's\nframe the ﬂashes are separated by time c\u0001t =1ma n d\ndistance \u0001x = 0. The interval between ﬂashes is therefore\n(\u0001s)2 =( c\u0001t)2 − (\u0001x)2 =1m 2.I n E ' s f r a m e c\u0001t0 =\nγ (1 m) and \u0001x = γu(1 m)=c, so the interval is (\u0001s0)2 =\nγ2 (1 − u2=c2)(1 m 2). Since γ \u0011 (1 − u2)−1=2,( \u0001 s0)2 =\n(\u0001s)2 =1m 2. Any other observer moving at any other\nspeed w with respect to D will measure di\u000berent time and\nspace separations, but a similar argument will show that\nthe interval is still 1 m2.\nThe proper time \u0001\u001c between two events is the time\nexperienced by an observer in whose frame the events\ntake place at the same point if there is such a frame. As\nthe above example shows, the square root of the invariant\ninterval between the two events is c times the proper time,\nor c\u0001\u001c =\np\n(\u0001s)2. The proper time is the length of time\nseparating the events in D's frame, a frame in which both\nevents occur at the same place. If the interval is positive,\nthere always is such a frame, because positive interval\nmeans jc\u0001tj > j\u0001rj so a frame moving at vector velocity\nv =( \u0001 r)=(\u0001t), in which the events take place at the\nsame point, is moving at a speed less than that of light.\nIf the interval between two events is less than zero,\ni.e., (\u0001s)2 < 0, it is still invarant even though there is no\nframe in which both events take place at the same point.\nThere is no such frame because necessarily it would have\nto move faster than the speed of light. To demonstrate the\ninvariance in this case, consider the clock-synchronizing\nprocedure described in Section 3.4: two ﬂashes are emit-\nted together from a point halfwaybetween the clocks, sep-\narated by one meter. The clocks start when the ﬂashes\narrive, two events which are simultaneous in their rest\nframe. In the rest frame the two starting events are\nseparated by c\u0001t =0a n d\u0001 x =1m . T h ei n t e r v a l\nis (\u0001s)2 = −1m 2. In the frame moving at speed u\nwith respect to the rest frame, the clocks are separated\nby (1 m)=γ and they are moving so the light takes time\n(0:5m ) =[γ(c+u)] to get to one clock and (0:5m ) =[γ(c−u)]\nto get to the other so c\u0001t0 is c times the di\u000berence be-\ntween these, or γu(1 m)=c.L i g h t t r a v e l s a t c so the\ndisplacement \u0001x0 is the c times the sum, or γ (1 m). The\ninterval is (\u0001s0)2 = −1m 2, same as in the rest frame.\nSince any other relative speed w could have been used,\nthis shows that the interval is invariant even if it is neg-\native.\nSometimes the proper distance \u0001\u0015 is de\fned to be\nthe distance separating two events in the frame in which\nthey occur at the same time. It only makes sense if the\ninterval is negative, and it is related to the interval by\n\u0001\u0015 =\np\nj(\u0001s)2j.\nOf course the interval (\u0001s)2 can also be exactly equal\nto zero. This is the case in which (c\u0001t)2 =( \u0001 r)2,o r\nin which the two events lie on the worldline of a photon.\nBecause the speed of light is the same in all frames, a\ninterval equal to zero in one frame must equal zero in all\nframes. Intervals with (\u0001s)2 = 0 are called \\lightlike\" or\n\\null\" while those with (\u0001s)2 > 0 are called \\timelike\"\n1920 Chapter 4. The Lorentz transformation\nand (\u0001s)2 < 0 are called \\spacelike\". They have di\u000berent\ncausal properties, which will be discussed in Chapter 5.\n4.2 Derivation of the Lorentz transformation\nIt would be nice to have algebraic formulae which allow\nus to compute the coordinates (ct0;x 0;y 0;z0)o fa ne v e n ti n\none frame given the coordinates (ct;x;y;z) of the event in\nsome other frame. In this section we derive these formu-\nlae by assuming that the interval is invariant and asking\n\\what kind of boost transformation will preserve the in-\nterval?\", making one or two appeals to common sense on\nthe way.\nWe want to \fnd the linear\u0003 transformation that takes\nthe coordinates (ct;x;y;z) of a 4-displacement in frame\nF to the coordinates (ct0;x 0;y 0;z0)i th a si nf r a m eG so\nthat the interval is invariant and G is moving at speed\nu = \fcin the x-direction with respect to F.\nIn Section 2.3, we argued that there are no length\ndistortions in the directions perpendicular to the direction\nof motion. This means that the y-a n dz-coordinates of\nan event in F m u s tb et h es a m ea st h o s ei nG;\ny0 = y\nz0 = z (4.3)\nLinearity requires that the x0 and t0 components must\nbe given by\nct 0 = Lt0t ct+ Lt0x x\nx0 = Lx0t ct+ Lx0xx (4.4)\nwhere the Li0j are constants; or, in matrixy form,\n\u0012\nct 0\nx0\n\u0013\n=\n\u0012\nLt0t Lt0x\nLx0t Lx0x\n\u0013\u0012\nct\nx\n\u0013\n(4.5)\nFrom the previous chapter, we know that two events\nthat occur in F at the same place (so \u0001x = 0) but\nseparated by time c\u0001t occur in G separated by time\nc\u0001t0 = γc\u0001t and therefore separated in space by \u0001x0 =\n−\fc\u0001t0 = −\fγc\u0001t,w h e r e ,a su s u a lγ \u0011 (1 − \f2)−1=2.\nThis implies\nLt0t = γ\nLx0t = γ\f (4.6)\n\u0003The reader may ask: why need the transformation be linear? It\nneeds to be linear because straight worldlines (i.e. constant-velocity\nworldlines) in one frame must transform into straight worldlines in\nall other frames.\nyFor a review of matrix algebra, see the excellent textbook by\nStrang (1976). In short, a column vector multiplied by a matrix\nmakes another column vector according to the rule\n0\n@\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\n1\nA =\n0\n@\na11 a12 a13 a14\na21 a22 a23 a24\na31 a32 a33 a34\na41 a42 a43 a44\n1\nA\n0\n@\nx1\nx2\nx3\nx4\n1\nA\n=\n0\n@\na11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3 + a14x4\na21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3 + a24x4\na31x1 + a32x2 + a33x3 + a34x4\na41x1 + a42x2 + a43x3 + a44x4\n1\nA\nThis is easily generalized to larger or smaller dimensions.\nWe also know that between any two events, the inter-\nval \u0001s2 is the same in all frames. When \u0001y =\u0001 z =0 ,\n(\u0001s)2 =( c\u0001t)2 − (\u0001x)2. Combined with the above two\nmatrix elements, the requirement that (\u0001s)2 =( \u0001 s)02\nimplies\nLt0x = −γ\f\nLx0x = γ (4.7)\nSo we \fnd that the transformation of the coordinates\nfrom one frame F to another G that is moving in the\nx-direction at relative speed +u = \fcis given by\n0\nB\nB\n@\nct 0\nx0\ny0\nz0\n1\nC\nC\nA =\n0\nB\nB\n@\nγ −γ\f 00\n−γ\f γ 00\n00 1 0\n00 0 1\n1\nC\nC\nA\n0\nB\nB\n@\nct\nx\ny\nz\n1\nC\nC\nA (4.8)\n4.3 The Lorentz transformation\nThe Lorentz transformation (hereafter LT) is very im-\nportant and deserves some discussion. The LT really\ntransforms di\u000berences (c\u0001t;\u0001x;\u0001y;\u0001z) between the\ncoordinates of two events in one frame to di\u000berences\n(c\u0001t0;\u0001x0;\u0001y0;\u0001z0) in another frame. This means that\nif one is going to apply the LT directly to event coor-\ndinates, one must be very careful that a single event is\nat the origin (0;0;0;0) of both frames.z In the previous\nsection, we placed event P at the origin of both frames.\nA simple consistency check we could apply to the LT\nis the following: If we boost to a frame moving at u,a n d\nthen boost back by a speed −u, we should get what we\nstarted with. In other words, LTs with equal and opposite\nspeeds should be the inverses of one another. If we change\nu !− u,w eh a v e\f !− \f and γ ! γ,s ob o o s t i n gt h e\ncoordinates (ct0;x 0)i nf r a m eK back to H and giving the\nnew coordinates double-primes, we have\nct\n00 = γc t\n0 + \fγx\n0\n= γ (γc t− \fγx )+\fγ(−\fγc t+ γx)\n= γ2 (ct − \fx− \f2 ct + \fx )\n= γ2 (1 − \f2)ct\n= ct (4.9)\nx00 = \fγc t 0 + γx 0\n= \fγ(γc t− \fγx)+γ (−\fγc t+ γx)\n= γ2 (\fc t− \f2 x − \fc t+ x)\n= γ2 (1 − \f2)x\n= x; (4.10)\nso indeed, the boost of −u is the inverse of the boost of\nu.\nThe LT as de\fned above has the primed frame (K)\nmoving at speed +u with respect to the unprimed frame\n(H). This is not a universal convention, but I will try to\nstick to it.\nzThere is a more general class of transformations,Poincar\u0013 et r a n -\nformations, which allow translationsof the coordinateorigin as well\nLTs (which include boosts and, as we will see, rotations).4.4.

The\nsimple but incorrect answer is w = u + v. The correct\nanswer can be quickly calculated with a Lorentz trans-\nformation.

From M's point of view, the journey will\ntake time T =2 `=u \u0019 60 yr, so L will return when M is\n80. How much will L have aged over the same period?\nIn Section 2.1 we learned that moving clocks go slow,\nso L will have aged by T0 = T=γ,w h e r eγ \u0011 (1−\f2)−1=2\nand \f \u0011 u=c.F o r u =0 :99c, γ = 7, so L will have\naged less than 9 yr. That is, on L's arrival home, M will\nbe 80, but L will only be 28! Strange, but in this special\nrelativistic world, we are learning to livewith strangeness.\nDuring his journey, Ming starts to get confused about\nthis argument. After all, there is no preferred reference\nframe. If one looks at the Earth from the point of view\nof Ming's rocket, one sees the Earth travel out at speed u\nand come back. So isn't L's clock the one that runs slow,\nand won't L the one who will be younger upon return?\nHow can this be resolved?\nIn Figure 4.2, the worldlines of L and M are plot-\nted in the rest frame of the Earth (frame S), with L's\ndeparture marked as event D, L's turnaround at the dis-\ntant star as T and her return home as R. You will re-\ncall that in Section 4.1 we saw that along a worldline,\nthe proper time, or time elapsed for an observer travel-\nling along the worldline, is the square root of the interval\n(\u0001s)2 =( c\u0001t)2 − (\u0001x)2.

The Lorentz transformationChapter 5\nCausality and the interval\nThe sign of the interval (\u0001s)2 (i.e., whether it is posi-\ntive or negative) is discussed in terms of causality in this\nChapter. If one event can a\u000bect another causally, the in-\nterval between them must be positive. By preserving the\ninterval, therefore, the Lorentz transformation preserves\nalso the causal structure of the Universe, provided that\nnothing travels faster than light. This is the reason for\nthat universal speed limit.\n5.1 The ladder and barn revisited\nRecall the \\ladder and barn\" paradox discussed in Sec-\ntion 3.3, in which N is at rest with respect to a barn, and\nP is carrying a long ladder but running so that it will be\nlength contracted and therefore \ft.\nConfused by the discussion of relativity of simultane-\nity in Chapter 3, N decides to prove that ladder does\nindeed \ft into the barn by replacing the back door with\nan incredibly strong, rigid, and heavy back wall that does\nnot open. Now when P enters the barn, he cannot leave,\nand the question is: does the front door ever close at all?\nIf it closes, the ladder must be really inside the barn in\nall frames because there is no back door through which\nit can be exiting. Thus instead of asking whether event\nC happens before or after D, a frame-dependent ques-\ntion, we are asking whether C happens at all. This is a\nframe-independent question.\u0003\nIn N's frame, event C, the closing of the front door,\nmust happen because the front of the ladder does not hit\nthe back wall until event C has occurred. That is, the\nladder does not even \\know\" that the back door has been\nreplaced by a brick wall until event C has occurred, so\nif event C, the closing of the front door, happened when\nthe back door was open, it must still happen now that\nthe back door is no longer there.\nIn P's frame the front of the ladder hits the back of\nthe barn before the back of the ladder enters, as we saw\nin Section 3.3. But does this mean that the ladder will\nstop and event C will no longer happen? To answer this\nquestion, we will have to actually do some Physics for the\n\u0003Events are frame-independent entities in the sense that if an\nevent occurs in one frame, it must occur in all. One cannot\n\\undo\" the fact that one sneezed by changing frames! On the other\nhand, relationships between events such as simultaneity are frame-\ndependent or relative.\n\frst time in these notes.\nIf I am standing at one end of a long table of length\n` and I push on the table to move it, how quickly can\nsomeone standing at the other end feel the table move?\nMy pushing on the table sets up a compression wave that\ntravels at the speed of sound cs in the table. The person\nat the other end feels the push when the wave gets there,\nat a time `=cs after I push. In everyday experience, this\ntime is fairly short, so we are not aware of the time delay\nbetween the push at one end and the feeling at the other.\nBut if we stand at opposite ends of a very long, stretched\nslinky, this time delay is easily observable.\nBecause, as we will see, no object or piece of matter\ncan ever travel faster than the speed of light and because\nall information is transferred via either matter or light\nitself, no information or signal or, in particular, compres-\nsion wave, can ever travel faster than the speed of light.\nThis means that no matter how rigid and strong I build\nmy table, the earliest possible time that the person at the\nother end can feel my push is at a time `=c after I push,\nwhere c is now the speed of light.\nWhy this digression? Because it applies to the prob-\nlem at hand. Sure, in P's frame, the front of the ladder\nhits the back of the barn before the back of the ladder\nenters, but this information cannot reach the back of the\nladder until some \fnite time after the collision. So the\nback of the ladder doesn't know that anything has gone\nawry at the front and it continues to move. When does\nthe back of the ladder learn of the front's collision? To\nanswer this we need to draw spacetime diagrams. Fig-\nure 5.1 shows the spacetime diagrams in the two frames.\nEvent D is the collision of the ladder with the back wall,\nand we have added event E, the earliest possible mo-\nment at which the back of the ladder can learn of the\ncollision at the front. This event is separated from the\ncollision event by a photon trajectory, because the max-\nimum speed at which the information can travel is the\nspeed of light. In both frames we see that the back of the\nladder enters the barn and event C occurs before the back\nof the ladder learns about the collision. In other words,\nthe back of the ladder makes it into the barn and the\ndoor closes behind it. What does this imply? It implies\nthat the ladder must be compressible or fragile. The fact\nthat the speed of sound in the ladder cannot exceed the\nspeed of light ensures that all materials are compressible.\n2526 Chapter 5.

The news of the collision cannot travel\nfaster than the speed of light so it cannot reach the back of\nthe ladder before event E.\nLoosely speaking, this is because a totally incompress-\nible substance has an in\fnite sound speed, and that is\nnot allowed. There are many fun problems in relativity\nbased on this type of argument, discussion of which is\nprevented by lack of space. One important application is\na proof that dark (i.e., not burning nuclear fuel), compact\nobjects more massive than about three times the mass of\nthe Sun must be black holes: any other material, even a\ncrystal composed of pure neutrons, can only hold itself\nup under that kind of pressure if it is so rigid that the\nspeed of sound in the material would necessarily exceed\nthe speed of light!\n\u000f Problem 5{1: Imagine a plank of length ` supported\nat both ends by sawhorses in a gravitational \feld of ac-\nceleration g.

How do you think this problem is resolved given\nthe discussion in this Section? If you \fnd a solution to\nthis problem which does not make use of the concepts\nintroduced in this Section, come see me right away!\n5.2 Causality\nEvent order is relative, but it is subject to certain con-\nstraints. By changing frames in the ladder-and-barn para-\ndox, we can make event D precede, be simultaneous with,\nor follow event E. But we cannot make any pair of events\nchange their order simply by changing frames. For in-\nstance, if Quentin (Q) throws a ball to Rajesh (R), the\nevent of the throw A must precede the event of the catch\nB in all frames. After all, it is impossible for R to catch\nthe ball before Q throws it!\nIf indeed events A and B are the throwing and catch-\ning of a ball, we can say something about their x and\nt coordinates. The spatial separation \u0001x between the\nevents must be less than the time (in dimensions of dis-\ntance) c\u0001t between the events because the ball cannot\ntravel faster than the speed of light. For such a pair of\nevents the interval\n(\u0001s)2 =( c\u0001t)2 − (\u0001x)2 (5.1)\nmust be positive. Events with positive interval must oc-\ncur in the same order in all frames because activity at the\nearlier event can a\u000bect activity at the later event. Such\na pair of events has a timelike spacetime separation, and\nit is sometimes said that A is in the causal history of B,\nor B is in the causal future of A.\nIn the case of events C and D in the ladder-and-barn\nparadox, the interval between the events is negative, and\nany signal or information or matter traveling between the\nevents would have to travel faster than the speed of light.\nThus activity at each of these events is prevented from\na\u000becting activity at the other, so there is no logical or\nphysical inconsistency in having a boost transformation\nchange their order of occurence. Such a pair of events\nhas a spacelike spacetime separation. They are causally\ndisconnected.\nFor completeness we should consider events D and E\nin the ladder-and-barn paradox. These events are sep-\narated by a photon world line or (c\u0001t)2 =( \u0001 x)2,s o\nthe interval is zero between these events. Such a pair of\nevents is said to have a lightlike or null spacetime sepa-\nration. Two events with a null separation in one frame\nmust be have a null separation in all frames because the\nspeed of light is the same in all frames.\n5.3 Nothing can travel faster than the speed of\nlight\nThe well-known speed limit|nothing can travel faster\nthan the speed of light|follows from the invariant causal\nstructure of the Universe. If one event is in the causal\nhistory of another in one frame, it must be in that causal\nhistory in all frames, otherwise we have to contend with\nsome pretty wacky physics.y For instance, reconsider the\nabove example of Q and R playing catch. Imagine that\nQ and R are separated by ` in their rest frame S,a n d\nQ throws the ball to R at twice the speed of light. The\nspatial separation between events A and B is \u0001x = ` and\nthe time separation is c\u0001t = `=2. Now switch to a frame\nS0 moving at speed v in the direction pointing from Q to\nR. Applying the Lorentz transformation, in this frame\n\u0001t0 = γ`\n\u0012\n1\n2\n− v\n\u0013\n(5.2)\nyThe reader who objects that special relativity is already fairly\nwacky will be ignored.5.3. Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light 27\nwhich is less than zero if v>1=2. In other words, in\nframes S0 with v>1=2, event B precedes event A. I.e.,\nin S0 R must catch the ball before Q throws it. A little\nthought will show this to be absurd; we are protected\nfrom absurdity by the law that nothing, no object, signal\nor other information, can travel faster than the speed of\nlight. Thus we have been justi\fed, earlier in this chapter,\nand elsewhere in these notes, in assuming that nothing\ncan travel faster than the speed of light.28 Chapter 5. Causality and the intervalChapter 6\nRelativistic mechanics\n6.1 Scalars\nA scalar is a quantity that is the same in all reference\nframes, or for all observers. It is an invariant number.\nFor example, the interval (\u0001s)2 separating two events A\nand B is a scalar because it is the same in all frames.\nSimilarly, the proper time \u0001\u001c between two events on a\nworldline is a scalar. In Chapter 2, the number of ticks of\nD's clock in going from planet A to planet B is a scalar\nbecause although observers disagree on how far apart the\nticks are in time, they agree on the total number.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the time interval \u0001t be-\ntween two events, or the distance \u0001x between two events,\nor the the length ` separating two worldlines are not\nscalars: they do not have frame-independent values\u0003.\n6.2 4-vectors\nBetween any two distinct events A and B in spacetime,\nthere is a time di\u000berence c\u0001t and three coordinate di\u000ber-\nence \u0001x,\u0001 y and \u0001z. These four numbers can be written\nas a vector ~ x with four components, which is called a 4-\nvector:\n~ x =( c\u0001t;\u0001x;\u0001y;\u0001z) (6.1)\nThe 4-vectory ~ x is actually a frame-independent object,\nalthough this is a fairly subtle concept. The components\nof ~ x are not frame-independent, because they transform\nby the Lorentz transformation (Section 4.3). But event\nA is frame independent: if it occurs in one frame, it must\noccur in all frames, and so is event B,s ot h e r ei ss o m e\nframe-independent meaning to the 4-vector displacement\nor 4-displacement between these events: it is the 3+1-\ndimensional arrow in spacetime that connects the two\nevents.\nThe frame-independence can be illustrated with an\nanalogy with 3-dimensional space. Di\u000berent observers set\nup di\u000berent coordinate systems and assign di\u000berent coor-\ndinates to two points P and Q, say Pittsburgh, PA and\nQueens, NY. Although both observers agree that they\nare talking about Pittsburgh and Queens, they assign\ndi\u000berent coordinates to the points. The observers can\n\u0003Forget high school|where all single-component numbers were\nprobably referred to as \\scalars.\"\nyThe conventionin these notes is to denote 4-vectors with vector\nhats and 3-vectors with bold face symbols.\nalso discuss the 3-displacement r separating P and Q.\nAgain, they may disagree on the coordinate values of this\n3-vector, but they will agree that it is equal to the vector\nthat separates points P and Q. They will also agree on\nthe length of r and they will agree on the angle it makes\nwith any other vector s, say the vector displacement be-\ntween P and R (Richmond, VA). In this sense the points\nand 3-vector are frame-independent or coordinate-free ob-\njects, and it is in the same sense that events and 4-vectors\nare frame-independent objects.\nWith each 4-displacement we can associate a scalar:\nthe interval (\u0001s)2 along the vector. The interval associ-\nated with ~ x is\n(\u0001s)2 =( c\u0001t)2 − (\u0001x)2 − (\u0001y)2 − (\u0001z)2 (6.2)\nBecause of the similarity of this expression to that of the\ndot product between 3-vectors in three dimensions, we\nalso denote this interval by a dot product and also by\nj~ xj2:\n~ x \u0001 ~ x \u0011j ~ xj\n2 \u0011 (c\u0001t)2 − (\u0001x)2 − (\u0001y)2 − (\u0001z)2 (6.3)\nand we will sometimes refer to this as the magnitude or\nlength of the 4-vector.\nWe can generalize this dot product to a dot product\nbetween any two 4-vectors ~ a =( at;a x;a y;a z)a n d~ b =\n(bt;b x;b y;b z):\n~ a \u0001~ b \u0011 at bt − axbx − ay by − az bz (6.4)\nIt is easy to show that this dot product obeys the rules\nwe expect dot products to obey: associativity over addi-\ntion and commutativity. The nice result is that the dot\nproduct produces a scalar. That is, the dot product of\nany two 4-vectors in one frame equals their dot product\nin any other frame.\nWhen frames are changed, 4-displacements transform\naccording to the Lorentz transformation. Because 4-\ndisplacements are 4-vectors, it follows that all 4-vectors\ntransform according to the Lorentz transformation. This\nprovides a simple (though slightly out-of-date) de\fnition\nof a 4-vector: an ordered quadruple of numbers that\ntransforms according to the Lorentz transformation.\nBecause scalars, by de\fnition, do not change under\na Lorentz transformation, any 4-component object which\ntransforms according to the Lorentz transformation can\n2930 Chapter 6. Relativistic mechanics\nbe multiplied or divided by a scalar to give a new four-\ncomponent object which also transforms according to the\nLorentz transformation. In other words, a 4-vector mul-\ntiplied or divided by a scalar is another 4-vector.\n\u000f Problem 6{1: Show that the 3+1-dimensional dot\nproduct obeys associativity over addition, i.e., that\n~ a \u0001 (~ b +~ c)=~ a \u0001~ b +~ a \u0001~ c (6.5)\nand commutativity, i.e., that ~ a \u0001~ b =~ b \u0001~ a.\n\u000f Problem 6{2: Show that the dot product of two\n4-vectors is a scalar. That is, show that for any two 4-\nvectors ~ a and~ b, their dot product in one frame S is equal\nto their dot product in another S0 moving with respect\nto S.\n\u000f Problem 6{3: Show that 4-vectors are closed under\naddition. That is, show that for any two 4-vectors ~ a and\n~ b,t h e i rs u m~ c = ~ a +~ b (i.e., each component of ~ c is just\nthe sum of the corresponding components of ~ a and ~ b)i s\nalso a 4-vector. Show this by comparing what you get by\nLorentz transforming and then summing with what you\nget by summing and then Lorentz transforming.\n6.3 4-velocity\nWhat is the 3+1-dimensional analog of velocity? We\nwant a 4-vector so we want a four-component object that\ntransforms according to the Lorentz transformation. In\n3-dimensional space, 3-velocity v is de\fned by\nv \u0011 lim\n\u0001t!0\n\u0001r\n\u0001t\n=\ndr\ndt\n(6.6)\nwhere \u0001t is the time it takes the object in question to\ngo the 3-displacement \u0001r. The naive 3+1-dimensional\ngeneralization would be to put the 4-displacement \u0001~ x\nin place of the 3-displacement \u0001r. However, this in it-\nself won't do, because we are dividing a 4-vector by a\nnon-scalar (time intervals are not scalars); the quotient\nwill not transform according to the Lorentz transforma-\ntion. The \fx is to replace \u0001t by the proper time \u0001\u001c\ncorresponding to the interval of the 4-displacement; the\n4-velocity ~ u is then\n~ u \u0011 lim\n\u0001\u001c!0\n\u0001~ x\n\u0001\u001c\n(6.7)\nWhen we take the limit we get derivatives, and the proper\ntime \u0001\u001c is related to the coordinate time \u0001t by γ \u0001\u001c =\n\u0001t (where, as usual, γ \u0011 (1 − \f2)−1=2 and \f \u0011j vj=c), so\n~ u =\nd~ x\nd\u001c\n=\n\u0012\nc\ndt\nd\u001c\n;\ndx\nd\u001c\n;\ndy\nd\u001c\n;\ndz\nd\u001c\n\u0013\n=\n\u0012\ncγ\ndt\ndt\n;γ\ndx\ndt\n;γ\ndy\ndt\n;γ\ndz\ndt\n\u0013\n=( γc ;γv x;γv y;γv z) (6.8)\nwhere (vx;v y;v z) are the components of the 3-velocity\nv = dr=dt. Although it is unpleasant to do so, we often\nwrite 4-vectors as two-component objects with the \frst\ncomponent a single number and the second a 3-vector. In\nthis notation\n~ u =( γc ;γv) (6.9)\nWhat is the magnitude of ~ u? There are several ways\nto derive it, the most elegant is as follows. The magnitude\nj~ uj2 must be the same in all frames because ~ u is a four-\nvector. Let us change into the frame in which the object\nin question is at rest. In this frame ~ u =( c;0;0;0) because\nv =( 0 ;0;0) and γ = 1. Clearly in this frame j~ uj2 = c2\nor j~ uj = c. It is a scalar so it must have this value in all\nframes. Thus j~ uj = c in all frames. This trivial \\proof\"\nis a good model for problem-solving in special relativity:\nidentifysomething which is frame-independent, transform\ninto a frame in which it is easy to calculate, and calculate\nit. The answer will be good for all frames.\nThe reader may \fnd this a little strange. Some par-\nticles move quickly, some slowly, but for all particles, the\nmagnitude of the 4-velocity is c. But this is not strange,\nbecause we need the magnitude to be a scalar, the same in\nall frames. If I change frames, some of the particles that\nwere moving quickly before now move slowly, and some\nof them are stopped altogether. Speeds (magnitudes of\n3-velocities) are relative; the magnitude of the 4-velocity\nhas to be invariant.\n\u000f Problem 6{4: Apply the formula for the magnitude\nof a 4-vector to the general 4-velocity (γc ;γv x;γv y;γv z)\nto show that its magnitude is indeed c.\n6.4 4-momentum, rest mass and conservation\nlaws\nJust as in non-relativistic 3-space, where 3-momentum\nwas de\fned as mass times 3-velocity, in spacetime 4-\nmomentum ~ p is mass m times 4-velocity ~ u. Under this\nde\fnition, the mass must be a scalar if the 4-momentum\nis going to be a 4-vector. If you are old enough, you may\nhave heard of a quantity called \\relativistic mass\" which\nincreases with velocity, approaching in\fnity as an object\napproaches the speed of light. Forget whatever you heard;\nthat formulation of special relativity is archaic and ugly.\nThe mass m of an object as far as we are concerned is its\nrest mass, or the mass we would measure if we were at\nrest with respect to the object.\nRest mass is a scalar in that although di\u000berent ob-\nservers who are all moving at di\u000berent speeds with respect\nto the object may, depending on the nature of their mea-\nsuring apparati, measure di\u000berent masses for an object,\nthey all can agree on what its mass would be if they were\nat rest with respect to it. In this respect rest mass is like\nthe proper time scalar: the only observers whose clocks\nactually measure the proper time between two events are\nthe observers for whom the two events happen in the same\nplace. But all observers agree on what that proper time\nis.6.5. Collisions 31\nThe 4-momentum ~ p is thus\n~ p \u0011 m~ u\n=( γmc ;γmv x;γmv y;γmv z)\n=( γmc ;γmv) (6.10)\nAgain, by switching into the rest frame of the particle, we\n\fnd that j~ pj = mc. This is also obvious because ~ p = m~ u\nand j~ uj = c. As with 4-velocity, it is strange but true\nthat the magnitude of the 4-momentum does not depend\non speed. But of course it cannot, because speeds are\nrelative.\nWhy introduce all these 4-vectors, and in particu-\nlar the 4-momentum? In non-relativistic mechanics, 3-\nmomentum is conserved. However, by Einstein's princi-\nple, all the laws of physics must be true in all uniformly\nmoving reference frames. Because only scalars and 4-\nvectors are truly frame-independent, relativistically in-\nvariant conservation of momentum must take a slightly\ndi\u000berent form: in all interactions, collisions and decays\nof objects, the total 4-momentum is conserved.F u r t h e r -\nmore, its time component is energy E=c (we must divide\nby c to give it the same dimensions as momentum) and its\nspatial components make up a correct, relativistic expres-\nsion for the 3-momentum p. We are actually re-de\fning\nE and p to be\nE \u0011 γmc 2\np \u0011 γmv (6.11)\nPlease forget any other expressions you learned for E or\np in non-relativistic mechanics. Those other expressions\nare only good when speeds are much smaller than the\nspeed of light.\nA very useful equation suggested by the new, correct\nexpressions for E and p is\nv =\npc2\nE\n(6.12)\nBy taking the magnitude-squared of ~ p we get a rela-\ntion between m, E and p \u0011j pj,\nj~ pj2 = m2 c2 =\n\u0012\nE\nc\n\u00132\n− p2 (6.13)\nwhich, after multiplication by c2 and rearrangement be-\ncomes\nE2 = m2 c4 + p2 c2 (6.14)\nThis is the famous equation of Einstein's, which becomes\nE = mc 2 when the particle is at rest (p =0 ) . z\nIf we take the low-speed limits, we should be able to\nreconstruct the non-relativistic expressions for energy E\nand momentum p. In the low-speed limit \f \u0011 v=c \u001c 1,\nzA friend of mine once was passed by a youth-\flled automobile,\nthe contentsof which identi\fedhim as a physicist and shouted \\Hey\nnerd: E = mc2!\" What has just been discussed explains why he\nran down the street after the automobile shouting \\Only in the rest\nframe!\"\nand we willmakeuse of the fact that for small \u000f,( 1 + \u000f)n \u0019\n1+n\u000f. At low speed,\np = mv (1 − \f2)−1=2\n\u0019 mv+\n1\n2\nm\nv2\nc2 v\n\u0019 mv\nE = mc\n2 (1 − \f\n2)\n−1=2\n\u0019 mc 2 +\n1\n2\nmv2 (6.15)\ni.e., the momentum has the classical form, and the energy\nis just Einstein's famous mc 2 plus the classical kinetic\nenergy mv2=2. But remember, these formulae only apply\nwhen v \u001c c.\nConservation of 4-momentum is just like conservation\nof 3-momentum in non-relativistic mechanics. All the 4-\nmomenta of all the components of the whole system un-\nder study are summed before the interaction, and they\nare summed afterwards. No matter what the interaction,\nas long as the whole system has been taken into account\n(i.e. the system is isolated), the total 4-momentum ~ p be-\nfore must equal the total 4-momentum ~ q after. In e\u000bect\nthis single conservation law ~ p = ~ q summarizes four indi-\nvidual conservation laws, one for each component of the\n4-momentum.\n6.5 Collisions\nIt is now time to put conservation of 4-momentum into\nuse by solving some physics problems. The essential tech-\nnique is to sum up the total 4-momentum before and\ntotal 4-momentum after and set them equal. But just\nas in non-relativistic mechanics, there are tricks to learn\nand there are easy and di\u000ecult ways of approaching each\nproblem.\nIn non-relativistic mechanics, collisions divide into\ntwo classes: elastic and inelastic. In elastic collisions,\nboth energy and 3-momentum are conserved. In inelastic\ncollisions, only 3-momentum is conserved. Energy is not\nconserved because some of the initial kinetic energy of the\nbodies or particles gets lost to heat or internal degrees of\nfreedom. In relativistic mechanics, 4-momentum, and in\nparticular the time component or energy, is conserved in\nall collisions; no distinction is made between elastic and\ninelastic collisions. As we will see, this is because the cor-\nrect, relativistic expression we now use for energy takes\nall these contributions into account.\nIn Figure 6.1, a ball of putty of mass m is travelling\nat speed v towards another ball of putty, also of mass\nm, which is at rest. They collide and stick forming a\nnew object with mass M0 travelling at speed v0.I n a\nnon-relativistic world, M0 would be 2m and v0 would be\nv=2, a solution that conserves non-relativistic momentum\nbut not non-relativistic energy; classically this collision\nis inelastic. But in a relativistic world we \fnd that the\nnon-relativistic predictions for v0 and M0 are not correct\nand both energy and 3-momentum will be conserved.32 Chapter 6. Relativistic mechanics\nM v\n(b)\nm m v\n(a)\nFigure 6.1: (a) A ball of putty of mass m travels at speed\nv towards an identical ball which is at rest. (b) After the\ncollision the balls are stuck together and the combined lump\nhas mass M0 and speed v0.\nBefore the collision, the 4-momentum of the moving\nball is ~ pm =( γmc ;γmv ;0;0), where I have aligned the\nx-axis with the direction of motion, and of course γ \u0011\n(1−v2=c2)−1=2. The 4-momentumof the stationary ballis\n~ ps =( mc;0;0;0), so the total 4-momentum of the system\nis\n~ p = ~ pm + ~ ps =( [ γ +1 ]mc;γmv;0;0) (6.16)\nAfter the collision, the total 4-momentum is simply\n~ q =( γ0 M0 c;γ0 M0 v0;0;0) (6.17)\nwhere γ0 \u0011 (1 − v02=c2)−1=2.\nBy conservation of 4-momentum, ~ q = ~ p,w h i c hm e a n s\nthat the two 4-vectors are equal, component by compo-\nnent, or\nγ0 M0 c =[ γ +1 ]mc\nγ\n0 M\n0 v\n0 = γmv (6.18)\nThe ratio of these two components should provide v0=c;\nwe \fnd\nv0 =\nγv\nγ +1\n>\nv\n2\n(6.19)\nThe magnitude of ~ q should be M0 c; we \fnd\nM02 =[ γ +1 ] 2 m2 − γ2 m2 v2\nc2\n=\n\u0014\n1+2γ + γ2\n\u0012\n1 −\nv2\nc2\n\u0013\u0015\nm2\n=2 ( γ +1 )m2\nM0 =\np\n2(γ +1 )m\n> 2m (6.20)\nSo the non-relativistic answers are incorrect, and most\ndisturbingly, the mass M0 of the \fnal product is greater\nthan the sum of the masses of its progenitors, 2m.\nWhere does the extra rest mass come from? The an-\nswer is energy. The collision is classically inelastic. This\nmeans that some of the kinetic energy is lost. But en-\nergy is conserved, so the energy is not actually lost, it is\njust converted into other forms, like heat in the putty, or\nrotational energy of the combined clump of putty, or in\nvibrational waves or sound traveling through the putty.\nStrange as it may sound, this internal energy actually\nincreases the mass of the product of the collision.\nThe consequences of this are strange. For example, a\nbrick becomes more massive when one heats it up. Or,\na tourist becomes less massive as he or she burns calo-\nries climbing the steps of the Ei\u000bel Tower.x Or, a spin-\nning football hits a football player with more force than\na non-spinning one. All these statements are true, but\nit is important to remember that the e\u000bect is very very\nsmall unless the internal energy of the object in question\nis on the same order as mc 2. For a brick of 1 kg, that\nenergy is 1020 Joules, or 3 \u0002 1013 kWh, or my household\nenergy consumption over about ten billion years (roughly\nthe age of the Universe). For this reason, macroscopic\nobjects (like bricks or balls of putty) cannot possibly be\nput into states of relativistic motion in Earth-bound ex-\nperiments. Only subatomic and atomic particles can be\naccelerated to relativistic speeds, and even these require\nhuge machines (accelerators) with huge power supplies.\n\u000f Problem 6{5: Suppose the two balls of putty in Fig-\nure 6.1 do not hit exactly head-on but rather at a slight\nperpendicular displacement, so in the \fnal state the com-\nbined lump is spinning? How will this a\u000bect the \fnal\nspeed v0? And the \fnal mass M0? Imagine now that you\nstop the combined lump from spinning|will its mass be\ngreater than, equal to, or less than M0?\n6.6 Photons and Compton scattering\nCan something have zero rest mass? If we blindly substi-\ntute m = 0 into Einstein's equation E2 = m2 c4+p2 c2 we\n\fnd that E = pcfor a particle with zero rest mass (here\np is the magnitude of the 3-momentum). But v = pc 2=E,\nso such massless particles would always have to travel at\nv = c, the speed of light. Strange.\nOf course photons, or particles of light, have zero rest\nmass, and this is \\why\" they always travel at the speed\nof light. The magnitude of a photon's 4-momentum is\nzero, but this does not mean that the components are\nall zero; it just means that when the magnitude is calcu-\nlated, the time component squared, E2=c2, is exactly can-\ncelled out by the sum of the space components squared,\np2\nx + p2\ny + p2\nz = jpj2. Thus the photon may be mass-\nless, but it carries momentum and energy, and it should\nobey the law of conservation of 4-momentum. This was\nbeautifully predicted and tested in the famous Compton\nscattering experiment. We outline the theory behind this\nexperiment here.\nFigure 6.2 shows the schematic for Compton scatter-\ning. A photon of initial 3-momentum magnitude Q (or\nenergy Qc) approaches an electron of mass m that is es-\nsentially at rest. The photon scatters o\u000b of the electron,\nleavingat some angle \u0012 to the originaldirection of motion,\nand with some new momentum Q0 (or energy Q0c). The\nelectron leaves at some other angle \u001e and some speed\nv. The idea of the experiment is to beam photons of\nknown momentum Q at a target of stationary electrons,\nand measure the momenta Q0 of the scattered photons\nas a function of scattering angle \u0012. We therefore want to\nderive an expression for Q0 as a function of \u0012.\nxRelativity does not provide the principal reason that one can\nlose weight by excercising; you do the math.6.7. Mass transport by photons 33\nf\nQ\nQ\nv\nm\nafter before q\nFigure 6.2: Before and after pictures forCompton scattering.\nBefore the collision the 4-momenta of the photon and\nelectron are\n~ pγ =( Q;Q;0;0) (6.21)\n~ pe =( mc;0;0;0) (6.22)\nrespectively, and after they are\n~ qγ =( Q0;Q 0 cos\u0012;Q0 sin\u0012;0) (6.23)\n~ qe =( γmc ;γmvcos\u001e;−γmvsin\u001e;0) (6.24)\nrespectively, where we have aligned coordinates so the\ninitial direction of the photon is the x-direction, and the\nscatter is in the x-y plane. The conservation law is\n~ pγ + ~ pe = ~ qγ + ~ qe (6.25)\nbut there is a trick. We can move both the photon 4-\nmomenta to one side and both the electron momenta to\nthe other and square (where ~ a2 is just ~ a \u0001~ a):\n(~ pγ − ~ qγ)2 =( ~ qe − ~ pe)2 (6.26)\n~ pγ \u0001~ pγ +~ qγ \u0001~ qγ −2~ pγ \u0001~ qγ = ~ pe\u0001~ pe+~ qe\u0001~ qe−2~ pe\u0001~ qe (6.27)\nFor all photons ~ p\u0001~ p = 0 and for all electrons ~ p\u0001~ p = m2 c2.\nAlso, in this case, ~ pγ \u0001~ qγ = QQ 0−QQ 0 cos\u0012 and ~ pe\u0001~ qe =\nγm 2 c2,s o\n−2QQ 0 (1 − cos\u0012)=2( 1− γ)m2 c2 (6.28)\nBut by conservation of energy, (γ −1)mcis just Q−Q0,\nand (a − b)=ab is just 1=b− 1=a,s ow eh a v ew h a tw ea r e\nlooking for:\n1\nQ0 −\n1\nQ\n=\n1\nmc\n(1 − cos\u0012) (6.29)\nThis prediction of special relativity was con\frmed in a\nbeautiful experiment by Compton (1923) and has been re-\ncon\frmed many times since by undergraduates in physics\nlab courses. In addition to providing quantitative con-\n\frmation of relativistic mechanics, this experimental re-\nsult is a beautiful demonstration of the fact that photons,\nthough massless, carry momentum and energy.\nQuantum mechanics tells us that the energy E of a\nphoton is related to its frequency \u0017 by E = h\u0017,a n dw e\nknow that for waves travelling at speed c, the frequency\n\u0017 and wavelength \u0015 are related by \u0015 = c=\u0017,s ow ec a nr e -\nwrite the Compton scattering equation in its traditional\nform:\n\u0015\n0 − \u0015 =\nh\nmc\n(1 − cos\u0012) (6.30)\n6.7 Mass transport by photons\nConsider a box of length L and mass m at rest on a\nfrictionless table. If a photon of energy E \u001c mc 2 is\nemitted from one end of the box (as shown in Figure 6.3)\nand is absorbed by the other, what is the reaction of the\nbox?\nm\nE v\nFigure 6.3: A thought experiment to demonstrate that there\nis a mass \u0016 = E=c2 associated with a photon of energy E.\nWe know the previous section that a photon of energy\nE carries momentum E=c,s ot oc o n s e r v em o m e n t u m ,t h e\nemission of the photon must cause the box to slide back-\nwards at a speed v given by mv = −E=c (where it is\nokay to use the classical formula mv for momentum be-\ncause we stipulated E \u001c mc 2 so γ \u001c 1). The photon\nis absorbed a time \u0001t later, and the box must stop mov-\ning (again to conserve momentum). In time \u0001t,t h eb o x\nmoves a distance\n\u0001xb = v\u0001t = −\nE\nmc\n\u0001t (6.31)\nand then stops, while the photon moves a distance\n\u0001xp = c\u0001t = L −\nE\nmc\n\u0001t (6.32)\nand then gets absorbed. Because the forces associated\nwith the emission and absorption of the photon are to-\ntally internal to be box, we do not expect them to be\nable to transport the center of mass of the box (see, e.g.,\nFrautschi et al., 1986, Chapter 11 for a non-relativistic\ndiscussion of this|it is a consequence of conservation\nof momentum). But because the box moved, the cen-\nter of mass can only have remained at rest if the photon\ntransported some mass \u0016 from one end of the box to the\nother. To preserve the center of mass, the ratio of masses,\n\u0016=m must be equal to the ratio of their displacements\n\u0001xb=\u0001xp,s o\n\u0016 = m\n\u0001xb\n\u0001xp\n=\nE\nc2 (6.33)\nThe transmission of the photon thus transports a mass\n\u0016 = E=c2.\nThis does not mean that the photon is massive. The\nrest mass of a photon is zero. It only shows that when\na photon of energy E is emitted, the emitter loses mass\n\u0001m = E=c2 and when it is absorbed the absorber gains\nmass \u0001m = E=c2.\n\u000f Problem 6{6: In Chapter 5 we learned that no signal\ncan travel through a solid body at a speed faster than that\nof light.

If we want to construct a complete,\ninvariant dynamics, analogous to Newton's laws but valid\nin all reference frames, we are going to need 4-acceleration\nand 4-force. Recall that we de\fned a 4-vector to be a\nfour component object that transforms according to the\nLorentz transformation. For this reason, the 4-velocity\n~ u and 4-momentum ~ p are de\fned in terms of derivatives\nwith respect to proper time \u001c rather than coordinate time\nt. The de\fnitions are ~ u \u0011 d~ x=d\u001c and ~ p \u0011 m~ u,w h e r e~ x is\nspacetime position and m is rest mass.\nFor this same reason, if we want to de\fne a 4-vector\nform of acceleration, the 4-acceleration ~ a, or a 4-vector\nforce, 4-force ~ K, we will need to use\n~ a \u0011\nd~ u\nd\u001c\n(6.40)\n~ K \u0011\nd~ p\nd\u001c\n(6.41)\nBecause ~ p =( E;p), we have\n~ K =\n\u0012\ndE\nd\u001c\n;\ndp\nd\u001c\n\u0013\n: (6.42)\nBecause \u0001t = γ \u0001\u001c (where, as usual, γ \u0011 (1 −\nv2=c2)−1=2), the spatial part of the 4-force is related to\nNewton's force F, de\fned as F \u0011 dp=dt,b y\ndp\nd\u001c\n= γ F (6.43)\nAlso, if the rest mass m of the object in question is a\nconstant (not true if the object in question is doing work,6.10. 4-force 35\nbecause then it must be using up some of its rest energy!),\nwe have that\n~ p \u0001 ~ p = m2 c2\nd\nd\u001c\n(~ p \u0001 ~ p)=0\nd~ p\nd\u001c\n\u0001 ~ p + ~ p \u0001\nd~ p\nd\u001c\n=0\n~ p \u0001 ~ K = 0 (6.44)\ni.e., if the rest mass is not changing then ~ p and ~ K are\northogonal. In 3+1-dimensional spacetime, orthogonality\nis something quite di\u000berent from orthogonalityin 3-space:\nit has nothing to do with 90\u000e angles.\nThe 4-force is only brought up here to whet the\nreader's appetite. We will actually have to make use of it\nin the (currently non-existent) Chapter on electricity.36 Chapter 6. Relativistic mechanicsChapter 7\nOptics and apparent e\u000bects: special\nrelativity applied to astronomy\nUp to now, we have always stipulated that observers\nmaking measurements are endowed with divine knowl-\nedge and excellent data analysis skills (recall Section 2.2).\nFor example, in Chapter 2, when E measured the rate\nof D's clock, she did not simply measure the time be-\ntween light pulses she received, she corrected them for\ntheir light-travel times in getting from D's clock to her\neyes. The corrections E made to the arrival times were\nonly possible because E was informed of D's trajectory\nbefore the experiment. Unfortunately, in many experi-\nments, we do not know in advance the trajectories of the\nobjects we are studying. This is especially true in as-\ntronomy, a subject which, among other things, attempts\nto reconstruct a 3+1-dimensional history of the Universe\nfrom a set of 2-dimensional telescope pictures which span\na very brief duration in time (in comparison with the age\nof the Galaxy or Universe).\nIn this chapter we discuss the appearance of objects\nto real observers.\n7.1 Doppler shift (revisited)\nConsider an object moving with respect to the Earth\nand which we are observing from Earth. Without loss\nof generality, we can choose the coordinate system for\nthe Earth's rest frame that puts the Earth at the spatial\norigin, the moving object a distance D away on the pos-\nitive x-axis, and puts the object's trajectory in the x-y\nplane. Its velocity vector v makes an angle \u0012 with the\nline of sight, as shown in Figure 7.1.\nq\nD\nv\nFigure 7.1: An object moving at relativistic velocity v with\nrespect to the Earth (symbolized by \\\b\") at an angle \u0012 to\nthe line of sight. Note that this is a diagram of space rather\nthan spacetime.\nLet us imagine that the moving object emits pulses of\nlight at intervals of proper time \u0001\u001ce, and that its distance\nfrom us D is much greater than c\u0001\u001ce.T h eq u e s t i o nw e\nwant to answer is this: If the light pulse emitted at time\n0 arrives at Earth at time t = D=c,h o wm u c hl a t e rd o e s\nthe next pulse arrive?\nThe next pulse is emitted a time \u0001te = γ \u0001\u001ce,l a t e r\n(where γ \u0011 (1 −\f2)−1=2, \f \u0011 v=c,a n dv \u0011j vj), at which\ntime the object is \u0001x = v \u0001te cos\u0012 further away, so the\nﬂash takes additional time \u0001x=c to get to us.

The analysis\nstill holds if we take the two events not to be ﬂashes, but\nsuccessive crests of an electromagnetic wave coming from\nthe object. The observed period is longer than the rest-\nframe period; the observed frequency is lower than the\nrest-frame frequency; the light is shifted to the red.\nIt is customary in astronomy to de\fne a dimensionless\nredshift z by\n(1 + z) \u0011\n\u0001tr\n\u0001\u001ce\n= γ (1 + \f cos\u0012) : (7.2)\nIn the simple case \u0012 = 0 (radial motion) the redshift is\ngiven by\n(1 + z)=γ (1 + \f)=\ns\n1+\f\n1 − \f\n; (7.3)\nand when \u0012 = \u0019 (inward radial motion) the redshift z is\nnegative, we call it a blueshift and it is given by\n(1 + z)=γ (1 − \f)=\ns\n1 − \f\n1+\f\n: (7.4)\nEven when the motion is perfectly tangential, \u0012 =\n\u0019=2, there is a redshift which originates solely in the γ\nf a c t o r .

In quantum mechanics,\nthe energy of a photon is proportional to the frequency of\nlight, which is the reciprocal of the time interval between\narrivals of successive wave crests.

In U's frame, the star is a distance r away and\nat an elevation angle \u0012 with respect to the x-axis. Light\ntravels at speed c, so for any photon coming from the star,\nthe 4-displacement \u0001~ x between the event of emission E\nand observation O in U's frame is\n\u0001~ x =( c\u0001t;\u0001x;\u0001y;\u0001z)\n=( −r;r cos\u0012;r sin\u0012;0) (7.7)\nwhere the time component is negative because emission\nhappens before observation. We apply the Lorentz trans-\nformation to get the components in V's frame\n\u0001~ x =( c\u0001t\n0;\u0001x\n0;\u0001y\n0;\u0001z\n0)\n=( −γr− γ\frcos\u0012;γ r cos\u0012 + γ\fr ;rsin\u0012;0)\n(7.8)\nwhere, as usual, \f \u0011 v=c and γ \u0011 (1 − v2=c2)−1=2.S i n c e\nthe photons also travel at speed c in V's frame, we can\nre-write this in terms of the distance r0 to the star and\nelevation angle \u00120 in V's frame:\n\u0001~ x =( −r0;r 0 cos\u00120;r 0 sin\u00120;0) (7.9)\nSolving for \u00120,\ncos\u00120 =\ncos\u0012 + \f\n1+\f cos\u0012\n(7.10)\ni.e., V observes the star to be at a di\u000berent angular po-\nsition than that at which U does, and the new position\ndoes not depend on the distance to the star.\nThis e\u000bect is stellar aberration and it causes the po-\nsitions on the sky of celestial bodies to change as the\nEarth orbits the Sun.\u0003 The Earth's orbital velocity is\n\u0018 30 kms−1 (\f =1 0 −4), so the displacement of an ob-\nject along a line of sight perpendicular to the plane of the\norbit (i.e., cos\u0012 =0 )i so nt h eo r d e ro f1 0 −4 radians or\n\u0018 20 arcseconds, a small angle even in today's telescopes.\nDespite this, the e\u000bect was \frst observed in a beautiful\nexperiment by Bradley in 1729.y\nNotice that as the speed v is increased, the stars are\ndisplaced further and further towards the direction of mo-\ntion. If U is inside a uniform cloud of stars and at rest\nwith respect to them, V will see a non-uniform distribu-\ntion, with a higher density of stars in the direction of her\nmotion relative to the star cloud and a lower density in\nthe opposite direction.\n7.3 Superluminal motion\nIt is observed that two components of the radio galaxy\n3C 273 are moving apart at \u0016 =0 :8 milliarcseconds per\nyear (Pearson et al 1981; recall that a milliarcsecond is\n1=1000 of 1=3600 of a degree). From the known rate of\nexpansion of the Universe and the redshift of the radio\ngalaxy, its distancez D from the Milky Way (our own\ngalaxy) has been determined to be 2:6 \u0002 109 light years\n(a light year is the distance light travels in one year).\nIf we multiply \u0016 by D we get the tangential component\nof the relative velocity of the two components. Because\nthere can also be a radial component, the velocity com-\nponent we derive will be a lower limit on the speed of the\nobject. Converting to radians we \fnd \u0016 =4\u0002 10−9 radi-\nans per year, so the tangential component of the velocity\nis roughly 10 light years per year! This is faster than\ntwice the speed of light, the maximum relative speed at\nwhich we should ever observe two objects to move. Rela-\ntive speeds exceeding 2c have now been observed in many\nradio galaxies, and recently even in a jet of material ﬂow-\ning out of a star in our own galaxy (Hjellming & Rupen\n\u0003Do not confuse this e\u000bect with parallax, which also causes the\npositions to change, but in a manner which depends on distance.\nyThe paper is Bradley (1729); an excellent description and his-\ntory of the experiment is Shankland (1964).\nzIn cosmology, there are many di\u000berentways of de\fningthe \\dis-\ntance\" betweeen two objects, reviewed by Weinberg (1972, Chap-\nter 14).

The\nobject is nearly moving directly towards the Earth, so \u0012\nis close to \u0019 radians or 180\u000e. The object emits ﬂashes at\nevents A and B, which are separated in time by \u0001te in\nthe Earth's rest frame. The distance between the events\nis much smaller than the distance D of the object from\nthe Earth.\nB\nv q\nD\nA\nFigure 7.2: An object moving at relativistic velocity v on\na trajectory that is nearly straight towards the Earth. The\nobject emits ﬂashes at points A and B.\nWhat is the time interval \u0001tr between the receptions\nof the two ﬂashes at the Earth? Flash A takes time D=c\nto get to us, but ﬂash B takes only D=c+(v \u0001te cos\u0012)=c\nto get to us because the object is closer (note that cos\u0012\nis negative). So\n\u0001tr =\u0001 te + \f \u0001te cos\u0012; (7.11)\nwhere \f \u0011 v=c.

If the\nradio galaxy contains a huge \\searchlight\" that sweeps\nits beam across intergalactic material, the speed of the\npatch of illumination can certainly exceed the speed of\nlight. Galaxies can act as gravitational \\lenses\" which\ndistort and magnify background objects; this magni\fca-\ntion can make slowly-moving objects appear superlumi-\nnal. The moving patches could be foreground objects,\nalthough this now appears very unlikely.)\n\u000f Problem 7{2: What is the minimum possible value\nof \f that could account for the observed proper motion\nin 3C 273? Assume that one component is not moving\ntangentially with respect to the Earth and the other is.\n7.4 Relativistic beaming\nConsider an object emitting photons in all directions\nisotropically. The brightness of the object is proportional\nto the amount of radiation (energy per unit time) which\nthe object emits into the pupil of the observer's eye or\ntelescope, and inversely proportional to the solid angle\n(angular area, measured in square arcseconds, square de-\ngrees, or steradians) occupied by the object. The dimen-\nsions of brightness are energy per unit time per unit solid\nangle. Thus if two objects emit the same amount of light,\nthe more compact one is brighter. Brightness is a useful\nquantity in astronomy because it is independent of dis-\ntance: as a lightbulb is moved away from an observer,\nthe amount of light from the bulb entering the observer's\neye or telescope goes down as the inverse square of the\ndistance, but the solid angular size of the bulb also goes\ndown as the inverse square of the distance. The bright-\nness is constant.\nOkay, the brightness of an object is independent of dis-\ntance, but how does it depend on how the object is mov-\ning relative to the observer? Doppler shift (Sections 6.9\nand 7.1) a\u000bects both the energy E (or momentum Q)o f\nthe photons and the rate of production Γ of the photons\n(i.e., number of photons emitted per unit time). In addi-\ntion, the photon directions are di\u000berent for the observer\nthan for someone in the rest frame of the object (as in\nstellar aberation, Section 7.2), so the fraction of emit-\nted photons entering the observer's eye or telescope will\nalso be a\u000bected by the object's speed and direction. For\nthe same reason that in stellar aberration (Section 7.2)\nobserved star positions are shifted into the direction of\nmotion of the observer, emitted photons are \\beamed\"\ninto the direction of motion of the emitter.\nSay the emitting object is at rest in frame S0,t h e\nrest frame, but moving at speed v = \fc in the positive\nx-direction in frame S, the frame of the observer. In its\nrest frame, the object emits photons of energy E0 = Q0c\nat rate Γ0 (photons per unit time). A photon emitted\nin a direction \u00120 relative to the x-axis in frame S0 has\n4-momentum\n~ p =( Q0;Q 0 cos\u00120;Q 0 sin\u00120;0) (7.13)\nwhere the y-direction has been chosen to make pz =0\n(Section 6.6). In frame S it will have some di\u000berent mo-\nmentum Q and angle \u0012 and the 4-momentum will be\n~ p =( Q;Q cos\u0012;Q sin\u0012;0) (7.14)\nbut it must be related to the 4-momentum in S0 by the\nLorentz transformation, so\nQ0 = γQ− γ\fQcos\u0012\nQ0 cos\u00120 = γQcos\u0012 − γ\fQ (7.15)\nThe \frst equation is just the Doppler shift (Sections 4.4\nand 7.1); the ratio gives\ncos\u00120 =\ncos\u0012 − \f\n1 − \f cos\u0012\n(7.16)\nwhich is exactly the same as the stellar aberration equa-\ntion (Section 7.2).\nIn the rest frame S0 the object emits isotropically, so\nthe rate per unit solid angle Ω (measured in steradians,\nor radians2)i sj u s t\ndΓ0\ndΩ0 =\nΓ0\n4\u0019\n(7.17)40 Chapter 7.

Consider the solid-\nangular ring of angular width d\u0012 at angle \u0012.T h i s r i n g\nhas solid angle\ndΩ=s i n\u0012d\u0012 (7.18)\nbut the photons emitted into that ring in S are emitted\ninto a di\u000berent ring in S0 with solid angle\ndΩ0 =s i n\u00120 d\u00120 (7.19)\nwhere \u0012 and \u00120 are related by (7.16). Taking the derivative\nof (7.16)\nsin\u00120 d\u00120 =\nsin\u0012d\u0012\n1 − \f cos\u0012\n+\n(cos\u0012 − \f)(\f sin\u0012d\u0012)\n(1 − \f cos\u0012)2\n=s i n \u0012d\u0012\n\u0014\n1 − \f2\n(1 − \f cos\u0012)2\n\u0015\n=\nsin\u0012d\u0012\nγ2 (1 − \f cos\u0012)2 (7.20)\nso the ratio of solid angles is\ndΩ\ndΩ0 = γ2 (1 − \f cos\u0012)2 (7.21)\nthe square root of which is the ratio of energies E0=E (by\nthe Doppler shift) or the ratio of rates of photon produc-\ntion Γ0=Γ (by the same). Putting it all together, since the\ninferred brightness is proportional to the energies times\nthe rate divided by the solid angle, the ratio of brightness\nI=I0 between the observer and rest frames is\nI\nI0 =[ γ (1 − \f cos\u0012)]\n−4 (7.22)\nor in terms of redshift, (1 + z)−4!\n\u000f Problem 7{3: Plot the observed brightness I as a\nfunction of angle \u0012 according to an observer at rest in\nS observing an object radiating isotropically in its rest\nframe S0.\n7.5 The appearance of passing objects\nConsider a rectangular plank of rest dimensionsx X \u0002 Y\nmoving at speed v = \fc in the x-direction, perpendicular\nto the line of sight to a distant observer, as shown in\nFigure 7.3.

From this\ninformation, as well as length contraction, compute the\napparent locations of all four corners.\n\u000f Problem 7{5: Why doesn't the observer see corner\nD?\n7.6 A simpleminded cosmology\nWe know that the Universe is expanding. In fact, we\nknow that except for a few, very close neighbours, other\ngalaxies are receding from our own and recession speed\nis proportional to distance from us. This e\u000bect is known\nas the Hubble ﬂow, named after the astronomer who \frst\ndiscovered it (Hubble, 1929). This Hubble ﬂow is natu-\nrally explained by a simple cosmological scenario in which\nthe Universe begins with an explosion, and this scenario\ndoes not require our galaxy to be at the center.\nConsider an in\fnite Lorentz frame S0 with a small\nrock at rest at the origin. At time t0 = 0 in this frame, the\nrock explodes into countless tiny fragments with masses\nsmall enough to ensure that gravitational forces do not\nsigni\fcantly a\u000bect the constant-velocity (speed and di-\nrection) trajectories. At time t0 > 0, there is some dis-\ntribution of fragments in space, with the faster-moving\nfragments further out from the explosion point. Because\nall fragment world lines are constant-velocity and pass\nthrough the event (0,0,0,0) in S0, the vector displacement\nr0 in frame S0 of a fragment with velocity v0 is given by\nr0 = v0 t0.\nNow consider another frame S which also has the ex-\nplosion at the origin, but which is moving along with one\nof the fragments not at rest in S0.I nS, all the fragments\nhave constant-velocity worldlines that pass through the\nevent (0,0,0,0). Therefore in S also, the displacement r\nat time t>0 of a fragment with velocity v is given by\nr = vt. That is, at any time t>0, recession speed is\nproportional to distance from the origin even though the\norigin is not at (or even at rest with respect to) the center\nof the explosion.\nIf at time t = t0 (now) we live on a fragment (the7.6. A simpleminded cosmology 41\nMilky Way) ejected by a huge explosion (the Big Bang)\nwhich occurred at time t = 0, and the fragments are not\nheavy enough to have signi\fcantly a\u000bected each other's\nvelocities via gravitational forces, then by the above ar-\ngument we expect to see other nearby fragments (other\ngalaxies) receding from us, with their recession speeds\nproportional to their distances from us; i.e. we expect a\nspherically symmetric Hubble ﬂow even if we are not at\nthe center of the Universe.\nOf course when we look at an extremely distant object\nnow, we are not seeing the object at its current position\nr(t0), but rather at its position r(te)a tt i m ete when it\nemitted the light that is now reaching us. Also, we have\nno direct measure of the distance re = jr(te)j, but we\ncan infer it from the redshift z of the light that it emits\nin, say, its hydrogen recombination lines (the rest-frame\nfrequencies of which we know). What is the relationship\nbetween z and re?\nct\nB\ne\nE\nO\nct\nx\nr\nb\ne r\ne\ne\no ct\nr\nFigure 7.4: The spacetime diagram used to derive the\nredshift-distance relation in a simpleminded cosmology.\nWorld lines of the Earth (vertical) and the fragment (slope\n1=\f)a r es h o w n . E v e n tB is the big bang, E the emission\nof light and O its observation now on Earth.\nFigure 7.4 is the spacetime diagram for a fragment\nmovingin S (where S is our rest frame) at velocity v,w i t h\ncoordinates aligned so that v points in the x-direction.\nThe Big Bang occurs at event B, the origin (ct= x =0 ) ;\nthe fragment emits light at event E (ct= ct e, x = re);\nand we observe the light at event O,n o w( ct = ct 0,\nx =0 ) .\nIt should be obvious from the diagram that ct 0 =\nre=\f + re,w h e r e\f = jvj=c and that the proper time\n\u001cBE elapsed for the fragment between B and E is given\nby (c\u001c BE)2 =( re=\f)2 − r2\ne. From these relations and\nthe fact that the redshift z is given by 1 + z = t0=\u001cBE\n(Section 7.1) it is easy to show that\nre = ct 0\n2z + z2\n2(1 + z)2 (7.23)\n(the student is encouraged to show this). It should be\nobvious, both from Figure 7.4 and the above equation,\nthat the maximum value for re is ct 0=2w h e nz !1 ,\nand that for small z, re = ct 0 z.\nIn addition to inference from redshift, the distance\nto a fragment can be determined several other ways. If\none knows the size of the fragment, its angular diameter\ncan be measured, and the ratio of the quantities should\nprovide the distance re. For this reason, re is referred\nto as the angular diameter distance{ to the object, and\nis often denoted dA. If the intrinsic luminosity L of a\nfragment is known, its ﬂux F can be measured, and the\nrelation F = L=(4\u0019r2) can be used to determine a dis-\ntance. However, the luminosity distance dL determined\nin this way is di\u000berent from dA by four factors of (1+ z)\nbecause of the e\u000bect of redshift on brightness discussed\nin Section 7.4.\nThe cosmology presented in this section is a simple\nMilne cosmology, a more general version of which (in-\ncluding gravity) is described by Milne (1934). Most cos-\nmologists now believe that the expansion of the Universe\nis governed by general relativity, but it is nonetheless true\nthat most cosmological observations can be explained by\nthis simple kinematic model.\n{Experienced cosmologists will notice that equation (7.23) is\nidentical in form to the equation derived, via general relativity, for\nthe angular diameter distance in a \\spatially curved, isotropic, ho-\nmogeneous, empty space.\" See, e.g., Weinberg (1972) or Peebles\n(1993) for the general-relativistic derivation.42 Chapter 7.

The basic geometric structure underlying quasi-metric\nrelativity is a one-parameter family gt of Lorentzian 4-metrics parametrized by a\nglobal time function t. A linear and symmetric aﬃne connection ∇\n⋆\ncompatible\nwith the family gt is deﬁned, giving rise to equations of motion.\nFurthermore a quasi-metric theory of gravity, including ﬁeld equations and lo-\ncal conservation laws, is presented. The ﬁeld equations have only one dynamical\ndegree of freedom coupled explicitly to matter, but there is also a second, implicit\ndynamical degree of freedom. The existence of this implicit dynamical degree of\nfreedom makes the ﬁeld equations unsuitable for a standard PPN-analysis. This\nimplies that the experimental status of the theory is not completely clear at this\npoint in time. The theory seems to be consistent with a number of cosmological\nobservations and it satisﬁes all the classical solar system tests however. Moreover,\nin its non-metric sector the new theory has experimental support where General\nRelativity fails or is irrelevant.\n1 Introduction\nInterest in alternative classical theories of gravity has mainly focused on the class of\nmetric theories, deﬁned by the postulates [1]\n• Space-time is equipped with a single Lorentzian metric ﬁeld g,\n• The world lines of inertial test particles are geodesics of g,\n• In the local Lorentz frames, the non-gravitational physics is as in Special Relativity.\nOne reason for the neglect of non-metric theories is probably the successes of the leading\nmetric theory, General Relativity (GR): constructing alternative theories not deviating\ntoo signiﬁcantly in structure from GR seems compelling if one is not prepared to risk\nimmediate conﬂict with observation.\n1But another reason is possibly the belief that theories which do not satisfy the above\npostulates necessarily fail to satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) deﬁned by\nthe restrictions [1]\n• The trajectories of uncharged test particles do not depend on their internal com-\nposition (this is the Weak Equivalence Principle),\n• The outcomes of local non-gravitational test experiments do not depend on the\nvelocity of the apparatus (this is called local Lorentz invariance),\n• The outcomes of local non-gravitational test experiments do not depend on when\nor where they are performed (this is called local positional invariance).\nSince the empirical evidence supporting the EEP seems formidable [1], constructing a\ntheory violating it probably would be a waste of time. But is it really true that theories\nnot satisfying all the said postulates necessarily violate the EEP?\nNo, it is not. It can be shown that it is possible to construct a type of relativistic\nspace-time framework not satisfying the ﬁrst two postulates but where the EEP still holds\n[2]. This framework deﬁnes the geometrical basis for Quasi-Metric Relativity (QMR), just\nas semi-Riemannian geometry deﬁnes the geometrical basis for metric relativity.\nA general physical motivation for introducing the quasi-metric framework is found\ndirectly in the particular global structure of quasi-metric space-time. That is, the ge-\nometric structure behind QMR is constructed to yield maximal predictive power with\nregard to the large-scale properties of space-time. The basic idea that makes this pos-\nsible is that since the Universe is unique, so should the nature of its global evolution\nbe. That is, there should be no reason to treat the Universe as a purely gravitationally\ndynamic system and its global evolution should not depend on any particular choice of\ninitial conditions. This means that the global evolution of the Universe should be ex-\nplicitly included into the geometric structure of quasi-metric space-time as some sort of\nprior geometric property. It is natural to call the global evolution of the Universe “non-\nkinematical” since by construction, this evolution is unaﬀected by dynamics. In other\nwords, in QMR the global evolution of the Universe is described as a non-kinematical\ncosmic expansion. One important consequence of this is that a global arrow of time\nexists as an intrinsic, geometrical property of quasi-metric space-time. The quasi-metric\nframework thus represents an attractive solution of the problem of time-asymmetry. (See\ne.g. [3] and references therein for more on this problem.)\nThe quasi-metric framework and some of its predictions will be described in some\ndetail in the following. Note that since this paper is intended to be a not too lengthy\n2introduction to QMR, derivations of formulae are in general omitted. However, more\ndetailed derivations can often be found in [2].\n2 The quasi-metric space-time framework\n2.1 Basic mathematical structure\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the basic premise of the quasi-metric framework is\nthat the cosmic expansion should be described as a non-kinematical phenomenon. To\nfulﬁll this premise it is necessary that the canonical description of space-time is taken\nas fundamental. Furthermore, to ensure that the cosmic expansion really is global and\ndirectly integrated into the geometric structure of quasi-metric space-time, it is necessary\nto introduce the global time function t representing an extra, degenerate time dimension\n(see below). This extra time dimension must be degenerate since it is designed to describe\nthe cosmic expansion as a non-kinematical global scale change between gravitational and\nnon-gravitational systems. We will elaborate on this in the following where we deﬁne the\nquasi-metric framework precisely in terms of geometrical structures on a diﬀerentiable\nmanifold.\nMathematically the quasi-metric framework can be described by ﬁrst considering a\n5-dimensional product manifold M×R1, where M = S×R2 is a (globally hyperbolic)\nLorentzian space-time manifold, R1 and R2 are two copies of the real line and S is a\ncompact Riemannian 3-dimensional manifold (without boundaries). We see that it is\nnatural to interpret t as a coordinate on R1. Besides, the product topology of M implies\nthat once t is given, there must exist a “preferred” ordinary time coordinate x0 on R2\nsuch that x0 scales like ct. It is very convenient to choose a time coordinate x0 which\nscales like ct since this means that x0 is in some sense a mirror of t and that they thus are\n“equivalent” global time coordinates. A coordinate system with a global time coordinate\nof this type we call a global time coordinate system (GTCS). Hence, expressed in a GTCS\n{x } (where   can take any value 0−3), x0 is interpreted as a global time coordinate on\nR2 and {xj} (where j can take any value 1−3) as spatial coordinates on S. The class of\nGTCSs is a set of preferred coordinate systems inasmuch as the equations of QMR take\nspecial forms in a GTCS.\nWe now equip M×R1 with two degenerate 5-dimensional metrics ¯ gt and gt. By deﬁ-\nnition the metric ¯ gt represents a solution of ﬁeld equations, and from ¯ gt one can construct\nthe “physical” metric gt which is used when comparing predictions to experiments. To\nreduce the 5-dimensional space-time M×R1 to a 4-dimensional space-time we just slice\n3the 4-dimensional sub-manifold N determined by the equation x0 = ct (using a GTCS)\nout of M×R1. Moreover, in N ¯ gt and gt are interpreted as one-parameter metric fami-\nlies. Thus by construction N is a 4-dimensional space-time manifold equipped with two\none-parameter families of Lorentzian 4-metrics parameterized by the global time function\nt. This is the general form of the quasi-metric space-time framework. We will call N a\nquasi-metric space-time manifold. And the reason why N is diﬀerent from a Lorentzian\nspace-time manifold is that the aﬃne connection compatible with any metric family is\nnon-metric. This means that, while it is always possible to equip N with the single met-\nric obtained by inserting the explicit substitution t = x0/c into gt, this metric is useless\nfor other purposes than taking scalar products. That is, since the aﬃne structure on N\nis inherited from the aﬃne structure on M×R1, and since that aﬃne structure is not\ncompatible with any single metric on N (see below), one must separate between ct and\nx0 in gt.\nFrom the deﬁnition of quasi-metric space-time we see that it is constructed as consist-\ning of two mutually orthogonal foliations: on the one hand space-time can be sliced up\nglobally into a family of 3-dimensional space-like hypersurfaces (called the fundamental\nhypersurfaces (FHSs)) by the global time function t, on the other hand space-time can\nbe foliated into a family of time-like curves everywhere orthogonal to the FHSs. These\ncurves represent the world lines of a family of hypothetical observers called the funda-\nmental observers (FOs), and the FHSs together with t represent a preferred notion of\nspace and time. That is, the equations of any theory of gravity based on quasi-metric\ngeometry should depend on quantities obtained from this preferred way of splitting up\nspace-time into space and time. But notice that the structure of quasi-metric space-time\nhas no eﬀects on local non-gravitational test experiments.\nNext we describe the aﬃne structure on N. (Note that we introduce the coordinate\nnotation g(t) ν where the parenthesis is put in to emphasize that these are the components\nof a one-parameter family of metrics rather than those of a single metric.) Again we start\nwith the corresponding structure on M×R1. To ﬁnd that we should think of the metric\nfamily gt as one single degenerate metric on M×R1, where the degeneracy manifests\nitself via the condition gt( ∂\n∂t, )≡0. The natural way to proceed is to determine a torsion-\nfree, metric-compatible 5-dimensional “degenerate” connection\n⋆\n∇ on M×R1 from the\nmetric-preserving condition\n∂\n∂t\ngt(yt,zt) = gt(\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tyt,zt) + gt(yt,\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tzt), (1)\ninvolving arbitrary families of vector ﬁelds yt and zt in M. It turns out that it is possible\nto ﬁnd a unique candidate connection satisfying equation (1) in general and diﬀering from\n4the usual Levi-Civita connection only via connection coeﬃcients containing t. This can-\ndidate connection is determined from the in general non-zero connection coeﬃcients Γ\n⋆\nα\n t\nwhich must be equal to\n1\n2gασ\n(t)\n∂\n∂tg(t)σ  (we use Einstein’s summation convention through-\nout), since other connection coeﬃcients containing t must vanish identically.\nBut the above-mentioned candidate degenerate connection has one undesirable prop-\nerty, namely that it does not in general ensure that the unit normal vector ﬁeld family\nnt of the FHSs (with the property gt(nt,nt) = −1) is parallel-transported along\n∂\n∂t. It\nwould be natural to require this property, i.e.,\n⋆\n∇ should guarantee that\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tnt = 0, (2)\nsince if equation (2) does not hold the resulting equations of motion will not be identical\nto the geodesic equation derived from\n⋆\n∇. However, we may try to construct a unique\ndegenerate connection which satisﬁes equation (2) and is identical to the above-mentioned\ncandidate connection for those particular cases when the candidate connection satisﬁes\nequation (2). This is possible since the dependence of gt on t cannot be arbitrary. That\nis, the dependence of gt on t can be inferred independently and takes a particular form\n(see equation (12) below), making it possible to construct a unique degenerate connection\nwhich satisﬁes both equations (1) and (2) (given the particular dependence of gt on t).\nThis unique connection is determined from the form the connection coeﬃcients take in a\nGTCS, and the result is\nΓ\n⋆α\n t =\n1\nt\nδ\nα\ni δ\ni\n , Γ\n⋆α\nt  ≡Γ\n⋆α\n t, Γ\n⋆α\nν ≡Γ\nα\n(t)ν , (3)\nwhere Γα\n(t)ν  are the connection coeﬃcients of the family ∇t of Levi-Civita connections\ndeﬁned from the collection of single Lorentzian metrics on M. The restriction of\n⋆\n∇ to N is\ntrivial since it does not involve any projections. (That is, to apply\n⋆\n∇ in N one just applies\nit in the sub-manifold x0 = ct in a GTCS.) Notice that other degenerate connection\ncoeﬃcients than those given in equation (3) vanish identically. This implies that the\ngradient of the global time function is covariantly constant, i.e.,\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tdt =\n⋆\n∇ ∂\n∂x dt = 0.\nIt is in general possible to write gt as a sum of two terms\ngt = −gt(nt, )⊗gt(nt, ) + ht, (4)\nwhere ht is the family of spatial metrics intrinsic to the FHSs. Then equations (1) and\n(2) imply that\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tgt = 0,\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tht = 0, (5)\nthus the degenerate connection is compatible with the metric family as asserted.\n52.2 General equations of motion\nNow we want to use the above deﬁned aﬃne structure on N to ﬁnd equations of motion\nfor test particles in (N,gt). Let λ be an aﬃne parameter along the world line in N of\nan arbitrary test particle. (In addition to the aﬃne parameter λ, t is also a (non-aﬃne)\nparameter along any non-space-like curve in N.) Using an arbitrary coordinate system\n(not necessarily a GTCS) we may deﬁne coordinate vector ﬁelds ∂\n∂xα; then dt\ndλ\n∂\n∂t + dxα\ndλ\n∂\n∂xα\nis the coordinate representation of the tangent vector ﬁeld ∂\n∂λ along the curve. We then\ndeﬁne the degenerate covariant derivative along the curve as\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂λ≡\ndt\ndλ\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂t +\ndxα\ndλ\n⋆\n∇ ∂\n∂xα. (6)\nA particularly important family of vector ﬁelds is the 4-velocity tangent vector ﬁeld family\nut along a curve. By deﬁnition we have\nut≡u\nα\n(t)\n∂\n∂xα≡\ndxα\ndτt\n∂\n∂xα, (7)\nwhere τt is the proper time as measured along the curve.\nThe equations of motion are found by calculating the covariant derivative of 4-velocity\ntangent vectors along themselves using the connection in (N,gt). According to the above,\nthis is equivalent to calculating\n⋆\n∇ut along ∂\n∂τt. Using the coordinate representation of\n∂\n∂τt we may thus deﬁne the vector ﬁeld\n⋆\na by\n⋆\na≡\n⋆\n∇ ∂\n∂τt\nut =\n  dt\ndτt\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂t +\ndxα\ndτt\n⋆\n∇ ∂\n∂xα\n \nut≡\ndt\ndτt\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tut + at. (8)\nWe call this vector ﬁeld the “degenerate” 4-acceleration. We need to have an independent\nexpression for the degenerate acceleration ﬁeld\n⋆\na. This can be found by calculating the\nextra term\ndt\ndτt\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tut at the right hand side of equation (8). To do that it is convenient to\nintroduce the 3-velocity wt of an arbitrary test particle as seen by the FOs. That is, one\nmay split up the tangent 4-velocity into parts respectively normal and tangential to the\nFHSs, i.e.\nut =\n⋆\nγ(cnt + wt),\n⋆\nγ≡(1 −\nw2\nc2 )\n−1/2 =\ndτF\ndτt\n, (9)\nwhere w2 is the square of wt and dτF≡Ndt is the proper time interval of the local FO.\nHere N is the lapse function ﬁeld (as expressed in a GTCS) of the FOs. Note that wt is an\nobject intrinsic to the FHSs since gt(nt,wt)≡0. Moreover, from the general dependence\nof ¯ gt and gt on t given in equation (12) below, together with the requirement that w2\n6should be independent of t, we can ﬁnd the coordinate expressions in a GTCS of nt and\nwt. These are given by [2]\nn\n0\n(t) = N\n−1, n\nj\n(t) = −\nt0\nt\nNj\nN\n, w\n0\n(t) = 0, w\nj\n(t) =\ndxj\ndτF\n+\nt0\nt\nNj\nN\nc, (10)\nwhere the N\nj\n(t)≡\nt0\nt Nj are the components in a GTCS of the shift vector ﬁeld family of\nthe FOs. Here t0 is just some arbitrary epoch setting the scale of the spatial coordinates.\nNote that N and Nj do not depend explicitly on t. Also note that the proper time interval\ndτF≡Ndt may in principle be integrated along the world line of any FO given the implicit\ndependence N(x (t)) in (N,gt). This means that there is a direct relationship between\nt and the proper time elapsed for any FO. So, since N is non-negative by deﬁnition, t\nmust be increasing in the forward direction of time for any FO.\nBy using equations (3), (9) and (10) we may now show that\n⋆\n∇∂\n∂tut vanishes, so we in\nfact have\n⋆\na=at from equation (8). The coordinate expression for\n⋆\na then yields equations\nof motion, namely\nd2xα\ndλ2 +\n \nΓ\n⋆α\ntσ\ndt\ndλ\n+Γ\n⋆α\nβσ\ndxβ\ndλ\n dxσ\ndλ\n=\n dτt\ndλ\n 2\na\nα\n(t). (11)\nEquation (11) is the geodesic equation obtained from\n⋆\n∇ and this implies that inertial\ntest particles follow geodesics of\n⋆\n∇. Note that while the form of equation (11) is valid in\ngeneral coordinates, the form of Γ\n⋆\nα\n t given in equation (3) is not.\nTo get the correspondence with metric gravity we formally set\nt0\nt = 1 and then take\nthe limit t→∞ in equations (3), (10) and (11). The equations of motion (11) then reduce\nto the usual geodesic equation in metric gravity. This limit represents the so-called metric\napproximation where the metric family gt does not depend on t. That is, in the metric\napproximation gt can be identiﬁed with one single Lorentzian metric g. Notice that\nin QMR, metric approximations are meaningful for isolated systems only. This is why\ncorrespondences between QMR and metric gravity can be found in e.g., the solar system\nbut not for cosmology (see section 4).\nHowever, except for the metric approximation, gt should not be identiﬁed with any\nsingle Lorentzian metric and equation (11) does not reduce to the usual geodesic equation\nin metric gravity due to terms explicitly depending on t. That is, in QMR inertial test\nparticles do not move as if they were following geodesics of any single space-time metric.\nAlso note that the equations of motion (11) do not violate local Lorentz invariance. To\nsee this, observe that the connection coeﬃcients may be made to vanish in any local\ninertial frame so that equation (11) takes its special relativistic form.\n73 Quasi-metric gravity\n3.1 Basic principles\nAt this point two questions naturally arise, namely\n• What is the role of t in the metric families gt and ¯ gt? and\n• Why should it be preferable to describe space-time by a metric family rather than\nby a single Lorentzian metric ﬁeld?\nThe answer to the ﬁrst question should be clear from the discussion in the previous\nsections. That is, by deﬁnition the role of t in the metric families is to describe global\nscale changes of the FHSs as measured by the FOs. This means that t should enter each\nmetric family explicitly as a spatial scale factor R(t). To avoid introducing some extra\narbitrary scale or parameter we just deﬁne R(t) = ct. (Further justiﬁcation of this choice\nof scale factor will be given later in this section.) Moreover the FHSs are by deﬁnition\ncompact to ensure the uniqueness of a global time coordinate. That is, by requiring the\nFHSs to be compact we ensure that t splits quasi-metric space-time into a unique set of\nFHSs. Besides, since there is no reason to introduce any nontrivial spatial topology, the\nglobal basic geometry of the FHSs (neglecting the eﬀects of gravity) should be that of\nthe 3-sphere S3.\nBut any restriction on the global geometry of the FHSs implies the existence of prior 3-\ngeometry. To prevent the possibility that the existence of prior 3-geometry may interfere\nwith the dynamics of ¯ gt, the family ¯ gt cannot be arbitrary but should take an even more\nrestricted form than would seem necessary from the above requirements. Now a sensible\nrestriction of ¯ gt would follow from the requirement that gravity should contain only one\ndynamical degree of freedom (i.e., that gravity is essentially scalar) in (N,¯ gt). This\nrequirement is fulﬁlled if, expressed in a GTCS, the most general form allowed for the\nfamily ¯ gt is represented by the family of line elements (this may be taken as a deﬁnition)\nds\n2\nt =\n \n¯ Ns ¯ N\ns − ¯ N\n2\nt\n \n(dx\n0)\n2 + 2\nt\nt0\n¯ Nidx\nidx\n0 +\nt2\nt2\n0\n¯ N\n2\nt Sikdx\nidx\nk, (12)\nwhere ¯ Nt is the lapse function ﬁeld family and where\nt0\nt ¯ Nk ∂\n∂xk is the family of shift\nvector ﬁelds in ¯ gt. Moreover Sikdxidxk is the metric of S3 (with radius equal to ct0) and\n¯ Ni≡ ¯ N2\nt Sik ¯ Nk. Note that whenever local conservation of energy and momentum holds,\n¯ Nt should not depend on t in (N,¯ gt) but that it may nevertheless depend explicitly on\nthe quantity x0\nct. (Violation of local conservation laws is expected to occur in the early\n8Universe implying that ¯ Nt will depend on t in (N,¯ gt), see section 4.) On the other hand, a\ncounterpart to the condition (2) in (N,¯ gt) implies that ¯ Nk cannot depend on t. Besides\nwe notice that the form (12) of ¯ gt is preserved only under coordinate transformations\nbetween GTCSs. Also note that the most general allowed metric approximation of ¯ gt\nis the single metric ¯ g obtained from equation (12) by setting\nt\nt0 = 1 and replacing the\nmetric of the 3-sphere with an Euclidean 3-metric.\nAs mentioned earlier, to get the correct aﬃne structure on (N,gt) one must separate\nbetween ct and x0 in gt. Similarly, to get the correct aﬃne structure on (N,¯ gt), one\nmust separate between ct and x0 in equation (12). But the possibility that ¯ Nt depends\nexplicitly on t means that the aﬃne structure on (N,¯ gt) will diﬀer slightly from that\non (N,gt). That is, since counterparts to equations (2) and (5) must exist in (N,¯ gt),\nthe t-dependence of ¯ Nt implies that the degenerate connection coeﬃcients in (N,¯ gt) will\nnot take a form exactly like that shown in equation (3). Rather, the in general non-\nvanishing connection coeﬃcients in (N,¯ gt) are given in a GTCS by (a comma denotes\npartial derivation)\n¯ Γ\n⋆0\nt0 =\n¯ Nt,t\n¯ Nt\n, ¯ Γ\n⋆i\ntj = (\n1\nt\n+\n¯ Nt,t\n¯ Nt\n)δ\ni\nj, ¯ Γ\n⋆α\nt ≡¯ Γ\n⋆α\n t, ¯ Γ\n⋆α\nν ≡¯ Γ\nα\n(t)ν . (13)\nNext we want to describe the evolution of the spatial scale factor ¯ Ft≡ ¯ Ntct of the FHSs\nin the hypersurface-orthogonal direction. By deﬁnition we have (the symbol ‘¯ ⊥’ denotes\na scalar product with −¯ nt)\n¯ F\n−1\nt £\n⋆\n¯ nt ¯ Ft≡ ¯ F\n−1\nt\n \n(c ¯ Nt)\n−1 ¯ Ft,t +£¯ nt ¯ Ft\n \n= (c ¯ Nt)\n−1\n 1\nt\n+\n¯ Nt,t\n¯ Nt\n \n−\n¯ Nt,¯ ⊥\n¯ Nt\n≡c\n−2¯ xt + c\n−1 ¯ Ht, (14)\nwhere £¯ nt denotes Lie derivation in the direction normal to the FHS, treating t as a\nconstant where it occurs explicitly. In equation (14) c−2¯ xt represents the kinematical\ncontribution to the evolution of ¯ Ft and c−1 ¯ Ht represents the so-called non-kinematical\ncontribution deﬁned by\n¯ Ht≡\n1\n¯ Ntt\n+ ¯ yt, ¯ yt≡c\n−1\n \n¯ aFk¯ ak\nF, c\n−2¯ aFj≡\n¯ Nt,j\n¯ Nt\n, (15)\nwhere ¯ aF is the 4-acceleration ﬁeld of the FOs in the family ¯ gt. We see that the non-\nkinematical evolution (NKE) of the spatial scale factor takes the form of an “expansion”\nsince ¯ Ht can never take negative values. Furthermore we observe that ¯ Ht does not\nvanish even if the kinematical evolution of ¯ Ft does and ¯ Nt is a constant in (N,¯ gt).\nFor this particular case (see section 4, equation (44) below) we have the relationship\n¯ Ht =\n1\n¯ Ntt =\n \n¯ Pt\n6 c, where ¯ Pt is the Ricci scalar curvature intrinsic to the FHSs. This\n9means that in quasi-metric relativity, a global increase in scale of the FHSs is linked to\ntheir global curvature. Moreover this global increase of scale has nothing to do with the\nkinematical structure described by any single Lorentzian metric ﬁeld. It follows that in\nQMR, the Hubble law is not interpreted as a kinematical law, rather the Hubble law is\ninterpreted as evidence for global spatial curvature. This reinterpretation of the Hubble\nlaw also justiﬁes the choice of scale factor R(t) = ct since no other choice fulﬁlls the above\nrelationship with ¯ Ht playing the role of a “Hubble parameter” for the special case when\n¯ Nt is a constant. In particular, notice that it is not possible to construct similar models\nwhere the global NKE takes the form of a “contraction” without introducing some extra\narbitrary scale.\nIt follows from the above discussion that quasi-metric space-time is manifestly time-\nasymmetric by construction, irrespective of the fact that dynamical laws are time-reversal\ninvariant. That is, quasi-metric space-time is time-asymmetric regardless of whether\nsolutions of dynamical equations are time-symmetric or not. For example, one may ﬁnd\ntime-symmetric (e.g. static) solutions for ¯ Nt from equation (12). But the scale factor\nis never time-symmetric, as can be seen from equation (14). This illustrates that the\nglobal time-asymmetry of quasi-metric space-time is due to the cosmological arrow of\ntime represented by the global cosmic expansion. Moreover, the existence of a global\narrow of time means that quasi-metric space-time has a simple causal structure.\nAn interpretation of the Hubble law as a direct consequence of the Universe’s global\nspatial curvature is impossible in metric theory. In fact, as mentioned in the introduction\nthe possibility of ﬁnding an alternative description of the cosmic expansion was part\nof the physical motivation for constructing QMR in the ﬁrst place. That is, in metric\ntheory a wide variety of cosmological models (and in particular time-symmetric ones) are\npossible in principle, and which one happens to describe our Universe is not deducible\nfrom ﬁrst principles. As a consequence the predictive power of metric theory is rather\nweak when it comes to cosmology. The main reason for this is that the expansion history\nof the Universe does not follow from ﬁrst principles in metric theory since it depends on\n(arbitrary) cosmic initial conditions and the corresponding solutions of dynamical ﬁeld\nequations.\nThe answer to the second question we posed above is now clear. In order to construct\na new theory with considerably more predictive power than metric theory in cosmology, it\nwould seem necessary to describe the cosmic expansion as non-kinematical, i.e., as some\nsort of prior geometric property of space-time itself. In this way an enormous multitude of\npossibilities regarding cosmic genesis and evolution will be eliminated just by postulating\nthat space-time is quasi-metric. This is why quasi-metric space-time should be preferred\n10over Lorentzian space-time as a matter of principle as long as this position is not in\nconﬂict with observations.\n3.2 Units and measurement\nThe fact that QMR describes global scale changes of the FHSs as non-kinematical suggests\nthe existence of two fundamentally diﬀerent scales in the Universe, one gravitational and\none atomic. This means that we have to specify which kind of units we are supposed to\nuse in equation (12). In metric theory it does not matter which kind of units one uses,\nbut in quasi-metric theory this is not so obvious. That is, is equation (12) equally valid in\nunits operationally deﬁned from systems where gravitational interactions are dominant,\nas in operationally deﬁned atomic units based on systems where gravitational interactions\nare insigniﬁcant? It turns out that the answer to this question is negative.\nThe units implicitly assumed when writing down line elements of the type (12) should\nbe “atomic” units; i.e., units operationally deﬁned by using atomic clocks and rods only.\nThis means that we may interpret the variation in space-time of the spatial scale fac-\ntor ¯ Ft as a consequence of the fact that we use atomic units to measure gravitational\nscales. Equivalently we may interpret the variation of ¯ Ft to mean that by deﬁnition, op-\nerationally deﬁned atomic units are considered formally variable throughout space-time.\n(This interpretation is possible since any non-local inter-comparison of operationally de-\nﬁned units is purely a matter of deﬁnition.) The formal variation of atomic units in\nspace-time means that gravitational quantities get an extra formal variation when mea-\nsured in atomic units (and vice versa). (This shows up explicitly e.g. in diﬀerential laws\nsuch as local conservation laws.) We now postulate that atomic units vary in space-time\njust as the inverse of the spatial scale factor ¯ Ft since this implies that the scale of the FHSs\ndoes not vary measured in gravitational units. That is, any gravitational quantity gets\na formal variability as some power of ¯ Ft when measured in atomic units. By deﬁnition\nc and Planck’s constant ~ are not formally variable (this yields no physical restrictions\nsince c and ~ cannot be combined to get a dimensionless number). This means that the\nformal variation of atomic length and atomic time units are identical and inverse to that\nof atomic energy (or mass) units. As a consequence, according to QMR the gravitational\ncoupling parameter Gt is not a constant measured in atomic units. But note that since\n¯ Ft is a constant in the Newtonian limit, Newtonian theory with a formally variable Gt is\ninconsistent with the Newtonian limit of QMR.\nBy dimensional analysis it is found that Gt varies as coordinate length squared mea-\nsured in atomic units (i.e., as ¯ F 2\nt ). But since Gt usually occurs in combination with\n11masses it is convenient to deﬁne Gt to take a constant value G and rather separate be-\ntween active mass mt (measured dynamically as a source of gravity) and passive mass m\n(i.e., passive gravitational mass or inertial mass). That is, we include the formal variation\nof Gt into mt, which means that the formal variation of active mass goes as ¯ Ft. This\nimplies that the formal variation of the active stress-energy tensor Tt (considered as a\nsource of gravitation) goes as ¯ F\n−2\nt . We thus have\nmt =\n¯ Ft\n¯ Ft0\nmt0 =\n¯ Ntt\n¯ N0t0\nm0, (16)\nwhere ¯ N0 and m0 denote values at some arbitrary reference event. (Formal variations of\nother gravitational quantities may be found similarly.) By convention we choose ¯ N0 = 1;\nthis means that the (hypothetical) reference situation is an empty Universe at epoch t0\n(see section 4).\nNote that the necessity to separate between gravitational and atomic scales represents\na violation of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP).\n3.3 Field equations\nIn metric theory there are no obstacles to having a full coupling between space-time\ngeometry and the stress-energy tensor T. In fact a full coupling is desirable since a\npartial coupling would result in so-called “prior” geometry, i.e., non-dynamical aspects of\nthe space-time geometry which are not inﬂuenced by matter sources. On the other hand,\nin QMR we have already restricted the metric family ¯ gt by requiring that it takes the form\n(12). We thus have prior geometry, and it is not diﬃcult to see that the prior geometry is a\ndirect consequence of the particular form of the spatial geometry postulated in (12). But\ncontrary to metric theory, in quasi-metric theory this kind of prior geometry is necessary\nsince it makes possible global scale changes of the FHSs due to the NKE. From equation\n(15) we see that global scale changes of the FHSs come from the the global part of the\nspatial curvature (obtained by setting ¯ Nt =constant on each FHS), so by deﬁnition it has\nnothing to do with gravity. It is thus reasonable to require that the intrinsic curvature\nof the FHSs should not couple explicitly to matter sources in quasi-metric gravity.\nThis means that we must look for ﬁeld equations which represent a partial coupling\nbetween space-time geometry and Tt, where the geometrical quantities involved should\nnot depend explicitly on the intrinsic curvature of the FHSs. Furthermore we should have\nmetric correspondence with Newtonian theory in a natural, geometrical way. Fortunately\nsuch a correspondence having all the wanted properties exists already in GR, yielding a\n12natural correspondence with GR as well. That is, we postulate one ﬁeld equation valid\nfor projections with respect to the FHSs, namely (using a GTCS)\n2 ¯ R(t)¯ ⊥¯ ⊥ = 2(c\n−2¯ a\ni\nF|i + c\n−4¯ aFi¯ a\ni\nF − ¯ K(t)ik ¯ K\nik\n(t) + £¯ nt ¯ Kt) = κ(T(t)¯ ⊥¯ ⊥ + ˆ T\ni\n(t)i), (17)\nwhere ¯ Rt is the Ricci tensor family and ¯ Kt is the extrinsic curvature tensor family (with\ntrace ¯ Kt) of the FHSs. Moreover κ≡8πG/c4, a “hat” denotes an object projected into\nthe FHSs and the symbol ‘|’ denotes spatial covariant derivation. The value of G is by\nconvention chosen as that measured in a (hypothetical) local gravitational experiment in\nan empty Universe at epoch t0. Note that ¯ aF is an object intrinsic to the FHSs. Also\nnote that all quantities correspond to the metric family ¯ gt.\nA second set of ﬁeld equations having the desirable properties of not being explicitly\ndependent on spatial curvature in addition to yielding a natural correspondence with GR\nis (in a GTCS)\n¯ R(t)j ¯ ⊥ = ¯ K\ni\n(t)j|i − ¯ Kt,j = κT(t)j ¯ ⊥, (18)\nagain valid for projections with respect to the FHSs. Superﬁcially, the ﬁeld equations\n(17) and (18) look just as a subset of the Einstein ﬁeld equations in ordinary GR. But the\ncrucial diﬀerence is that (17) and (18) are valid only for projections with respect to the\nFHSs; they do not hold for projections with respect to any other hypersurfaces. Contrary\nto this, in GR metric counterparts to equations (17) and (18) hold for projections with\nrespect to arbitrary hypersurfaces; this is a direct result of the Einstein ﬁeld equations.\nNotice that the ﬁeld equations (17), (18) are time-reversal invariant.\nWe now have a suﬃcient number of ﬁeld equations to determine the unknown quan-\ntities ¯ Nt and ¯ Nj in equation (12). Besides we observe that equation (17) represents one\ndynamical equation whereas equations (18) are constraints. To illustrate some general\nproperties of the ﬁeld equations it is useful to have an explicit expression for ¯ Kt, which\nmay be calculated from equation (12). Using a GTCS we ﬁnd\n¯ K(t)ij =\nt\n2t0 ¯ Nt\n( ¯ Ni|j + ¯ Nj|i) +\n  ¯ Nt,¯ ⊥\n¯ Nt\n−\nt0\nt\nc\n−2¯ aFk\n¯ Nk\n¯ Nt\n \n¯ h(t)ij, (19)\n¯ Kt =\nt0\nt\n¯ Ni\n|i\n¯ Nt\n+ 3\n  ¯ Nt,¯ ⊥\n¯ Nt\n−\nt0\nt\nc\n−2¯ aFk\n¯ Nk\n¯ Nt\n \n, (20)\nwhere ¯ ht is the metric family intrinsic to the FHSs in (N,¯ gt). Note that it is convenient\nto study systems where equations (17), (18) and (19) can be simpliﬁed. That is, to\nsimplify calculations it useful to consider systems where the condition\n¯ N\ni\n|i = 3c\n−2¯ aFi ¯ N\ni, ⇒ ¯ Kt = 3\n¯ Nt,¯ ⊥\n¯ Nt\n, (21)\n13holds. For example, by substituting equations (19) and (21) into equation (17) we easily\nsee the reason why ¯ Nt in general must depend on t; namely that the various terms in\nequation (17) scale diﬀerently with respect to the factor\nt0\nt . Note that even if the quantity\n¯ Nt,¯ ⊥ does get some extra variability on the FHSs due to the explicit dependence of ¯ Nt\non t, this does not necessarily apply to ¯ Nt itself.\nIt is also convenient to have explicit expressions for the curvature intrinsic to the\nFHSs. From equation (12) one easily calculates\n¯ H(t)ij = c\n−2\n \n¯ a\nk\nF|k −\n1\n¯ N2\nt t2\n \n¯ h(t)ij − c\n−4¯ aFi¯ aFj − c\n−2¯ aFi|j, (22)\n¯ Pt =\n6\n( ¯ Ntct)2 + 2c\n−4¯ aFk¯ a\nk\nF − 4c\n−2¯ a\nk\nF|k, (23)\nwhere ¯ Ht is the Einstein tensor family intrinsic to the FHSs in (N,¯ gt).\n3.4 Local conservation laws\nWithin the metric framework one usually just substitutes partial derivatives with covari-\nant derivatives when generalizing diﬀerential laws from ﬂat to curved space-time. In fact\nthis rule in the form “comma goes to semicolon” follows directly from the EEP in most\nmetric theories [1]. But in quasi-metric theory it is possible to couple non-gravitational\nﬁelds to ﬁrst derivatives of the scale factor of the FHSs such that the EEP still holds.\nThat is, any coupling of non-gravitational ﬁelds to the ﬁelds ¯ aFj,\n¯ Nt,¯ ⊥\n¯ Nt ,\n¯ Nt,t\n¯ Nt and 1\nt may be\nmade to vanish in the local inertial frames so that these couplings do not interfere with\nthe local non-gravitational physics.\nIn particular the EEP implies that the local conservation laws take the form ∇ T = 0\nin any metric theory based on an invariant action principle, independent of the ﬁeld\nequations [1]. The reason why the conservation laws must take this form is that they\nthen imply that inertial test particles move on geodesics of the metric. So, in said metric\ntheories the above form of the local conservation laws is suﬃcient to ensure that they are\nconsistent with the equations of motion. But in quasi-metric theory, consistency with the\nequations of motion does not necessarily imply that the local conservation laws take the\nform shown above. This fact, in addition to the possibility of extra couplings between\nnon-gravitational ﬁelds and the ﬁelds ¯ aFj,\n¯ Nt,¯ ⊥\n¯ Nt ,\n¯ Nt,t\n¯ Nt and\n1\nt, means that the EEP does not\nnecessarily imply a form similar to ∇ T = 0 of the local conservation laws in quasi-metric\ntheory. That is, the divergence\n⋆\n¯ ∇ Tt will in general not vanish, so the EEP is insuﬃcient\nto determine the form of the local conservation laws in QMR.\n14Since the EEP is not suﬃcient to determine the form of the local conservation laws\nin quasi-metric theory we have to deduce their form from other criteria. To do that we\nﬁrst write down the coordinate expression for\n⋆\n¯ ∇ Tt. This reads\nT\nν\n(t) ¯ ∗ν≡T\nν\n(t) ;ν + c\n−1T\n0\n(t) ¯ ∗t, (24)\nwhere the symbol ‘¯ ∗’ denotes degenerate covariant derivation compatible with the family\n¯ gt and a semicolon denotes metric covariant derivation in component notation. It is\nstraightforward to calculate the second term on the right hand side of equation (24), and\nassuming that the only t-dependence of Tt is via the formally variable units we ﬁnd\nT\n0\n(t) ¯ ∗t = −\n2\n¯ Nt\n 1\nt\n+\n¯ Nt,t\n¯ Nt\n \nT(t)¯ ⊥ . (25)\nSecond, in order to have the correct Newtonian limit in addition to being consistent with\nelectromagnetism coupled to gravity [4], the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of equation\n(24) must take the form\nT\nν\n(t) ;ν = 2\n¯ Nt,ν\n¯ Nt\nT\nν\n(t)  = 2c\n−2¯ aFi ˆ T\ni\n(t)  − 2\n¯ Nt,¯ ⊥\n¯ Nt\nT(t)¯ ⊥ . (26)\nBy applying (26) to a source consisting of a perfect ﬂuid with no pressure (i.e., dust)\nand projecting the resulting equations with the quantity ¯ gt +c−2¯ ut⊗¯ ut, we ﬁnd that the\ndust particles move on geodesics of\n⋆\n¯ ∇ in (N,¯ gt). This guarantees that the dust particles\nmove on geodesics of\n⋆\n∇ in (N,gt) as well; see section 3.5 for justiﬁcation. Besides, since\nTt is the active stress-energy tensor and since no extra ﬁeld independent of ¯ gt couples\nto gravitating bodies in QMR, this result should apply even to (suﬃciently small) dust\nparticles with signiﬁcant self-gravitational energy and not only to test particles. This\nmeans that although Gt is formally variable in QMR, no Nordtvedt eﬀect should be\nassociated with this formal variability.\nSince Tt is not directly measurable locally one must know how it relates to the passive\nstress-energy tensor Tt in (N,gt), or equivalently, to the passive stress-energy tensor ¯ Tt in\n(N,¯ gt) (which can be measured locally using atomic units). This means that equations\n(26) do not represent the “more physical” local conservation laws involving Tt. Besides the\nlocal conservation laws shown in (26) are compatible with ¯ gt and not with gt. However,\nsaid more physical local conservation laws are found by calculating\n⋆\n∇ Tt when gt is known.\nBut these more physical local conservation laws take no predetermined form.\nThe relationship between Tt and Tt (or ¯ Tt) depends in principle explicitly on the\ngeneral nature of the matter source. For example, this relationship will be diﬀerent for a\n15perfect ﬂuid consisting of material point particles than for pure radiation. To illustrate\nthis we may consider Tt for a perfect ﬂuid:\nTt = (˜ ρm + c\n−2˜ p)¯ ut⊗¯ ut + ˜ p¯ gt, (27)\nwhere ˜ ρm is the active mass-energy density in the local rest frame of the ﬂuid and ˜ p is\nthe active pressure. The corresponding expressions for Tt and ¯ Tt are\nTt =\n \n¯ ht\nht\n \n(ρm + c\n−2p)ut⊗ut + pgt\n \n, ¯ Tt = (ρm + c\n−2p)¯ ut⊗¯ ut + p¯ gt, (28)\nwhere ρm is the passive mass-energy density as measured in the local rest frame of the\nﬂuid and p is the passive pressure. Also, by deﬁnition ¯ ht and ht are the determinants of\n¯ ht and ht, respectively. Now the relationship between ˜ ρm and ρm is given by\nρm =\n\n\n\nt0\nt\n¯ N\n−1\nt ˜ ρm, for a ﬂuid of material point particles,\nt2\n0\nt2 ¯ N\n−2\nt ˜ ρm, for a null ﬂuid,\n(29)\nand a similar relationship exists between ˜ p and p. The reason why the relationship\nbetween ˜ ρm and ρm is diﬀerent for a null ﬂuid than for other perfect ﬂuid sources is\nthat gravitational or cosmological spectral shifts of null particles inﬂuence their passive\nmass-energy but not their active mass-energy.\n3.5 Constructing gt from ¯ gt\nAs mentioned previously the ﬁeld equations (17), (18) contain only one dynamical degree\nof freedom coupled explicitly to matter. To see this it is convenient to choose a system\nwhere the condition (21) holds. Then ¯ Kt = 3\n¯ Nt,¯ ⊥\n¯ Nt , and we see that the explicitly coupled\ndynamical ﬁeld is the lapse function ﬁeld ¯ Nt. But from equation (15) we see that spatial\nderivatives of ¯ Nt yield local contributions to the NKE of the FHSs as well. These local\ncontributions are not realized explicitly in the evolution of ¯ Ft, so whenever ¯ yt =0 in equa-\ntion (15), it is necessary to construct a new metric family gt. In the following we will\nsee the reason why.\nThe question now is just how the metric family (12) should be modiﬁed to include\nthe local eﬀects of the NKE. This question can be answered by noticing that according to\nequation (15), the local eﬀects of the NKE should take the form of an “expansion” that\nvaries from place to place. That is, the tangent spaces of the FHSs should experience\na varying degree of expansion as a consequence of the local contribution ¯ yt to ¯ Ht. Two\npoints now are that the local contribution ¯ yt to the expansion is due to gravitation\n16and that this contribution is not reﬂected explicitly in the evolution of the scale factor\n¯ Ft as can be seen from equation (14). Thus, whenever ¯ yt is nonzero we may think of\nchange of distances in any tangent space of the FHSs as consisting of an expansion plus a\ncontraction. That is, the FOs seem to “move” more than the explicit change of ¯ Ft should\nindicate. The modiﬁcation of the family (12) then consists of a compensation for this\nextra gravitationally induced “motion”.\nTo have a consistent transformation ¯ gt→gt we need to treat the eﬀects of the extra\ngravitationally induced “motion” in each tangent space, i.e., locally. To do that it turns\nout that we need to deﬁne a 3-vector ﬁeld bF representing the coordinate distance to a\nlocal ﬁctitious “center of gravity” in each tangent space. This is necessary to be able\nto deﬁne a family of 3-vector ﬁelds vt telling how much the FOs in each tangent space\n“recede” from the local “center of gravity” due to the gravitationally induced expansion.\nBesides, since the coordinate positions of all FOs must be unaﬀected, the FOs must\nsimultaneously “fall” with velocity −vt toward the local “center of gravity” to cancel out\nthe “recession”. And the extra “motion” involved induces corrections in the coordinate\nlength and time intervals as perceived by any FO. That is, the metric components of (12)\nin a GTCS must be modiﬁed to yield a new metric family gt.\nIn the special case where ¯ gt is spherically symmetric with respect to one distinguished\npoint, the spatial coordinates of this point represent a natural local “center of gravity” in\neach tangent space of the FHSs. In this case we obviously have bF = r\n∂\n∂r expressed in a\nspherical polar GTCS where the distinguished point lies at the origin. It seems reasonable\nto seek for an equation deﬁning bF which yields this solution for the spherically symmetric\ncase. Furthermore the wanted equation should be linear in bF to ensure unique solutions,\nand it should involve ¯ aF since any deviation from spherical symmetry will be encoded\ninto ¯ aF and its spatial derivatives. By inspection of the spherically symmetric case it\nturns out that it is possible to ﬁnd an equation which has all the desired properties,\nnamely\n \n¯ a\nk\nF|k + c\n−2¯ aFk¯ a\nk\nF\n \nb\nj\nF −\n \n¯ a\nj\nF|k + c\n−2¯ aFk¯ a\nj\nF\n \nb\nk\nF − 2¯ a\nj\nF = 0. (30)\nWith bF deﬁned from (30) we are now able to deﬁne the 3-vector family vt. Expressed\nin a GTCS the vector ﬁeld family vt by deﬁnition has the components [2]\nv\nj\n(t)≡¯ ytb\nj\nF, v = ¯ yt\n \n¯ h(t)ikbi\nFbk\nF, (31)\nwhere v is the norm of vt. Note that v does not depend explicitly on t except via the\npossible t-dependence of ¯ Nt.\n17Now gt is constructed algebraically from ¯ gt and v. To do that we ﬁrst include the\neﬀects of the gravitationally induced expansion as seen from new observers which do not\nexperience this extra expansion, they are by deﬁnition “at rest”. This yields a correction\nto spatial intervals in the bF-direction due to the radial Doppler eﬀect, the correction\nfactor being\n \n1+ v\nc\n1− v\nc\n 1/2\n. There is also an inverse time dilation correction factor (1− v2\nc2)1/2\nto coordinate time intervals. There are no correction factors for spatial intervals normal\nto the bF-direction. Second, the coordinate intervals for the said new observers get an\nidentical pair of correction factors when compared to observers (now by deﬁnition “at\nrest”) moving with relative velocity −vt.\nTo deﬁne transformation formulae it is convenient to deﬁne the unit vector ﬁeld\n¯ eb≡\nt0\nt ¯ ei\nb\n∂\n∂xi and the corresponding covector ﬁeld ¯ eb≡\nt\nt0¯ eb\nidxi along bF. Since it is in\ngeneral not possible or practical to construct a GTCS where ¯ eb is parallel to one of\nthe coordinate vector ﬁelds one expects that the transformation formulae deﬁning the\ntransformation ¯ gt→gt should involve components of ¯ eb. Requiring correspondence with\nthe spherically symmetric case one ﬁnds [2]\ng(t)00 =\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n 2\n¯ g(t)00, (32)\ng(t)0j =\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n  \n¯ g(t)0j +\nt\nt0\n2v\nc\n1 −\nv\nc\n(¯ e\ni\nb ¯ Ni)¯ e\nb\nj\n \n, (33)\ng(t)ij = ¯ g(t)ij +\nt2\nt2\n0\n4v\nc\n(1 − v\nc)2¯ e\nb\ni¯ e\nb\nj. (34)\nNotice that we have eliminated any possible t-dependence of ¯ Nt in equations (32)-(34)\nby setting t = x0/c where it occurs. This implies that N does not depend explicitly on t.\nSome tensor ﬁelds are required to preserve their norm under the transformation de-\nﬁned in equations (32)-(34). One particular example of this is the transformation ¯ Ft→Ft\nof the passive electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor family ¯ Ft in (N,¯ gt) to its counterpart Ft in\n(N,gt), where the latter enters into the Lorentz force law [4]. This suggests that the\ntransformation ¯ gt→gt deﬁned in equations (32)-(34) is only a particular case of a more\ngeneral transformation. That is, transformations similar to ¯ gt→gt should apply to any\ntensor ﬁeld which norm is required to be unchanged when ¯ gt→gt. As an example we\nlist the formulae deﬁning the transformation ¯ Zt→Zt where ¯ Zt is a rank one tensor ﬁeld\nfamily. (¯ Zt may, e.g., be identiﬁed with a general 4-velocity vector family ¯ ut.) These\nformulae read\nZ(t)0 =\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n \n¯ Z(t)0, Z\n0\n(t) =\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n −1\n¯ Z\n0\n(t), (35)\n18Z(t)j = ¯ Z(t)j +\n2v\nc\n1 −\nv\nc\n(¯ e\ni\nb ¯ Z(t)i)¯ e\nb\nj, ˆ Z\nj\n(t) = ˆ ¯ Z\nj\n(t) −\n2v\nc\n1 +\nv\nc\n(¯ e\nb\ni\nˆ ¯ Z\ni\n(t))¯ e\nj\nb. (36)\nIt is possible to ﬁnd similar transformation formulae valid for higher rank tensor ﬁeld\nfamilies. For illustrative purposes we also list formulae valid for the transformation\n¯ Qt→Qt, where ¯ Qt is a rank two tensor ﬁeld family. These formulae read\nQ(t)00 =\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n 2\n¯ Q(t)00, Q\n00\n(t) =\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n −2\n¯ Q\n00\n(t), (37)\nQ(t)0j =\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n  \n¯ Q(t)0j +\n2v\nc\n1 − v\nc\n(¯ e\ni\nb ¯ Q(t)0i)¯ e\nb\nj\n \n,\nˆ Q\n0j\n(t) =\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n −1 \nˆ ¯ Q\n0j\n(t) −\n2\nv\nc\n1 + v\nc\n(¯ e\nb\ni\nˆ ¯ Q\n0i\n(t))¯ e\nj\nb\n \n, (38)\nQ(t)ij = ¯ Q(t)ij +\n2v\nc\n(1 − v\nc)2¯ e\nk\nb(¯ e\nb\ni ¯ Q(t)kj + ¯ Q(t)ik¯ e\nb\nj),\nˆ Q\nij\n(t) = ˆ ¯ Q\nij\n(t) −\n2v\nc\n(1 +\nv\nc)2¯ e\nb\nk(¯ e\ni\nb\nˆ ¯ Q\nkj\n(t) + ˆ ¯ Q\nik\n(t)¯ e\nj\nb). (39)\nThese transformation formulae may easily be generalized to tensor ﬁeld families of higher\nrank. Notice that it is also possible to ﬁnd formulae for the inverse transformations\nZt→¯ Zt, Qt→¯ Qt and similarly for tensor ﬁeld families of higher rank.\nSince both ¯ ut and ¯ Ft transform according to the rules (35)-(39), so must any 4-\nacceleration ¯ at resulting from the Lorentz force acting on charged matter. This implies\nthat the norm of ¯ at must be invariant under the transformation. Since this result should\napply to all 4-accelerations determined from non-gravitational forces and since such forces\nmay in particular vanish, we may deduce that geodesic motion in (N,¯ gt) implies geodesic\nmotion in (N,gt). That is, any inertial observer in (N,¯ gt) must be inertial in (N,gt) as\nwell. Notice that the 4-acceleration ﬁeld ¯ aF does not in general transform according to\nthe rules (35)-(36) since ¯ aF is determined from the requirement that the FOs must move\nnormal to the FHSs rather than from some non-gravitational force acting on the FOs.\nBy construction the family ¯ gt contains only one propagating dynamical degree of\nfreedom. However the quantity v represents a second dynamical degree of freedom so one\nwould expect that the number of propagating dynamical degrees of freedom in (N,gt) is\ntwo, the same as in GR. Note that the dynamical degree of freedom represented by v is\nimplicit inasmuch as it is not explicitly coupled to matter ﬁelds.\nWe close this section by emphasizing that gt is the “physical” metric family in the\nsense that gt should be used consequently when comparing predictions of QMR to ex-\nperiments. That is, any laws given in terms of ¯ gt and its associated connection, e.g. the\n19local conservation laws deﬁned in (26), are not the “physical” laws; those must always\nbe in terms of gt and its associated connection when comparing directly to experiment.\nNevertheless it is sometimes necessary to use the laws in terms of ¯ gt and its associated\nconnection. For example, to be able to calculate ¯ gt it is in general necessary to use\nthe local conservation laws (26). But as long as one is aware of the correct relationship\nbetween laws and observables this should not represent any problem.\n3.6 Comparing theory to experiment\nTo be able to compare the predictions of quasi-metric theory to experiment it would\nbe useful to have some systematic weak ﬁeld approximation method similar to the\nparametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism developed for metric theories of grav-\nity. It is not a good idea to try to apply the standard PPN-formalism to our quasi-metric\ntheory, however. There are several reasons for this; one obvious reason is that the PPN-\nformalism neglects the non-metric aspects of QMR. This means that any PPN-analysis\nof our ﬁeld equations is limited to their metric approximations. But even these metric\napproximations are not suitable for a standard PPN-analysis since the resulting PPN-\nmetric ¯ g describes only the explicit dynamical degree of freedom and so is not the one\nto which experiments are to be compared. This means that the PPN-metric ¯ g will not\nhave an acceptable set of PPN-parameters according to metric theory. For example, a\nPPN-analysis of our ﬁeld equations yields the PPN-parameters γ = −1 and β = 0; both\nvalues are totally unacceptable for any viable metric theory. Moreover the diﬀerences\nbetween QMR and metric gravity regarding the implementation of the EEP show up\nvia the local conservation laws (26) since even in the metric approximation, these laws\nare diﬀerent from their counterparts in standard metric theory. This means that any\nconstraints on the PPN-parameters deduced from integral conservation laws [1] will not\nnecessarily hold in QMR.\nBesides, when one attempts to construct a “physical” PPN-metric g from ¯ g in the\nmanner discussed in the previous section one gets more complications. In particular the\nisotropic PPN coordinate system is not invariant under the transformation ¯ g→g. That\nis, isotropic coordinates for the metric g are diﬀerent from the isotropic coordinates one\nstarted out with in the ﬁrst place when solving the ﬁeld equations! The reason for this is,\nof course, that the construction of isotropic coordinates depends on the metric. But the\nmain problem here is that the PPN-formalism does not tackle properly the construction\nof g from ¯ g. That is, the PPN-formalism exclusively handles explicit dynamical degrees\nof freedom and neglects the possible existence of implicit dynamical degrees of freedom.\n20Consequently, the PPN-metric g may contain terms which do not occur in the PPN-metric\nobtained from any metric theory with only explicit dynamical degrees of freedom. Thus\nthe bottom line is that a standard PPN-analysis, even limited to metric approximations\nof QMR, will fail.\nThus the fact is that to be able to compare the predictions of our theory to grav-\nitational experiments performed in the solar system in a satisfactory way, a separate\nweak-ﬁeld expansion similar to the PPN-formalism should be developed. And since such\na formalism is lacking at this point in time it is not yet clear whether or not quasi-\nmetric theory is viable. However, if a separate formalism is developed it should have\nsome correspondence with the PPN-formalism to answer this question (minimizing the\nneed for reanalyzing weak-ﬁeld experiments within the new framework). But we may\nstill calculate speciﬁc solutions with high symmetry to get an idea how the quasi-metric\ntheory compares to GR. In particular, in the metric approximation we may calculate the\nexact counterpart to the Schwarzschild case of GR. That is, in Schwarzschild coordinates\nthe static, spherically symmetric vacuum solution of equation (17) is [2] (the t-labels are\nomitted everywhere when dealing with metric approximations)\nds\n2\n=\n  \n1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2 −\nrs\n2r\n 2 \n− (dx\n0)\n2 + [1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)\n2]\n−1dr\n2\n \n+ r\n2dΩ\n2, (40)\nwhere dΩ2≡dθ2 + sin\n2θdφ2 and\nrs≡\n2MG\nc2 , M≡c\n−2\n     \n¯ N(T¯ ⊥¯ ⊥ + ˆ T\ni\ni)d¯ V . (41)\nIn (41) M is the dynamically measured mass of the source and the integration is taken\nover the FHS. (The particular form of M follows directly from equation (17) applied\nto the interior of a spherically symmetric, static source when extrapolated to the exte-\nrior solution given by equation (40).) Furthermore, since bF = r ∂\n∂r for the spherically\nsymmetric case we easily ﬁnd from equations (15) and (31) that\nv =\nrsc\n2r\n \n1 + (\nrs\n2r)2. (42)\nThen using equations (32) and (34) we get\nds\n2 = −[1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)\n2]\n−2\n rs\n2r\n+\n \n1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2\n −2\n(dx\n0)\n2\n+[1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)\n2]\n−1\n rs\n2r\n+\n \n1 + (\nrs\n2r\n)2\n 2\ndr\n2 + r\n2dΩ\n2\n= −(1 −\nrs\nr\n+\n3\n8\nr3\ns\nr3 +    )(dx\n0)\n2 + (1 +\nrs\nr\n+\nr2\ns\n4r2 +    )dr\n2 + r\n2dΩ\n2. (43)\n21We see that this metric has no event horizon and that it is consistent with the four\n“classical” solar system tests. Note that this consistency is due to the existence of the\nimplicitly coupled dynamical degree of freedom represented by the scalar ﬁeld v.\nIt is important to notice that the metric (43) is only a metric approximation yielding\ncorrespondences between QMR and GR. But we may go beyond the metric approximation\nand include the eﬀects of the non-metric part of QMR in the spherically symmetric case.\nThis is done in [2] and [5] where it is shown that the quasi-metric theory predicts that\nthe size of the solar system increases according to the Hubble law, but in a way such that\nthe trajectories of non-relativistic test particles are not unduly aﬀected. However, this\nprediction has a number of observable consequences which are seen and in good agreement\nwith QMR [5], [6]. In particular the prediction that the solar system expands according\nto the Hubble law provides a natural explanation [6] of the apparently “anomalous”\nacceleration of some distant spacecraft as inferred from radiometric data [7].\nWe conclude that even if the PPN-formalism does not apply to QMR and that this\nmakes the predictions of QMR more diﬃcult to test against experiment, some of the\nnon-metric aspects of QMR seem to agree well with observations. This represents a\nchallenge for GR and other metric theories just as much as the successes of GR represent\na challenge for any alternative theory of gravity. But it is a mathematical fact that metric\ntheories are unable to handle the non-metric aspects of QMR in a geometrical manner,\nthus making it impossible to calculate any of these eﬀects from ﬁrst principles in metric\ngravity.\n4 Quasi-metric cosmology\n4.1 General predictions\nCosmology as done in QMR is radically diﬀerent from any possible approach to the\nsubject based on a metric theory of gravity. The main reason for this is, of course,\nthat in QMR the expansion of the Universe is not interpreted as a kinematical phe-\nnomenon. Rather, by construction the cosmic expansion is a prior-geometric property of\nquasi-metric space-time itself. This means that any concept of the Universe as a purely\ngravitationally dynamic system simply is not valid in QMR. Consequently many of the\nproblems encountered in traditional cosmology do not exist in quasi-metric cosmology.\nFor example, in QMR the expansion history of the Universe does not depend on its mat-\nter density, so there is no ﬂatness problem. Due to the coasting expansion no horizon\nproblem exists either, nor is there any need for a cosmological constant. Thus QMR\n22yields some cosmological predictions from ﬁrst principles, without the extra ﬂexibility\nrepresented by the existence of a set of cosmological parameters. In QMR there will be\ncosmological problems not encountered in metric gravity, however.\nThe lack of any sort of cosmic dynamics in QMR is realized mathematically by the fact\nthat no quasi-metric counterparts to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models\nexist [2]. However, one possible cosmological model with isotropic FHSs is the toy model\ngiven by the metric family\nds\n2\nt = ds\n2\nt = −(dx\n0)\n2 + (\nt\nt0\n)\n2\n  dr2\n1 − r2\n(ct0)2\n+ r\n2dΩ\n2\n \n= −(dx\n0)\n2 + (ct)\n2\n \ndχ\n2 + sin\n2χdΩ\n2\n \n, (44)\nwhich represents an empty universe. This is a family of S3×R space-time metrics, and\nit is easy to check that it satisﬁes the ﬁeld equations without sources and also equations\n(14), (15). Besides this empty model it is possible to have a toy cosmological model\nwhere the Universe is ﬁlled with an isotropic null ﬂuid. In this case one ﬁnds solutions of\nthe type ¯ Nt = exp[−K\n(x0)2\n(ct)2 ] (where K is a constant depending on the ﬂuid density) from\nequation (17). Such solutions also satisfy equation (26). But since ¯ Nt is constant on the\nFHSs in these models, we may transform the resulting gt into the metric family shown\nin equation (44) by doing trivial re-scalings of the time coordinate ¯ Ntx0→x0 and of the\nglobal time function ¯ Ntt→t. (Since ¯ Nt < 1 this means that the proper time elapsed for\nany FO at a given epoch is smaller for the null ﬂuid model than for the empty one.)\nIt is also possible to ﬁnd isotropic null ﬂuid models where there is local creation of null\nparticles. In such models ¯ Nt will depend on t in (N,¯ gt), and equation (25) is violated.\nNow one peculiar aspect of QMR is that gravitationally bound bodies made of ideal\ngas and their associated gravitational ﬁelds are predicted to expand according to the\nHubble law [2], [5]. That is, if hydrostatic instabilities due to the expansion may be\nneglected (there are no such instabilities for an ideal gas), measured in atomic units linear\nsizes within a gravitationally bound system increase as the scale factor, i.e., proportional\nto t. Note that this is valid even for the quantity c−2GMt (where Mt is any active mass),\nwhich has the dimension of length. On the other hand it is a prediction of QMR that\nexcept for a global cosmic redshift not noticeable locally, the electromagnetic ﬁeld is\nunaﬀected by the global cosmic expansion [4]. This means that there is no reason to\nexpect that atoms or other purely quantum-mechanical systems should participate in the\ncosmic expansion. (To clarify the eﬀect of the expansion on atoms it would be necessary\nto perform calculations involving quantum ﬁelds in quasi-metric space-time.)\nA universe ﬁlled with an isotropic ﬂuid consisting of material particles is not possible\n23in QMR. That is, for any toy model universe ﬁlled with a perfect ﬂuid source described by\nan equation of state diﬀerent from ρmc2 = 3p, ¯ Nt must necessarily vary in space as well as\nin time [2]. However the more relativistic the ﬂuid, the closer its equation of state to that\nof a null ﬂuid and the weaker the spatial dependence of ¯ Nt will be. This means that one\nexpects the deviations from isotropy to be very small in the early Universe, and eventually\nto shrink to zero in the limit t→0. On the other hand one expects the spatial variability\nof ¯ Nt to increase when the primeval cosmic matter cools and eventually becomes non-\nrelativistic. That is, one expects that gravitational perturbations from isotropy must\nnecessarily increase with cosmic epoch in QMR. Thus no ﬁne-tuning will be necessary to\nget a clumpy universe from a near-isotropic beginning.\nA valid interpretation of equation (44) is that ﬁxed operationally deﬁned atomic\nunits vary with epoch t in such a way that atomic length units shrink when t increases.\nThis means that no matter can have been existing from the beginning of time since\natomic length units increase without bound in the limit t→0. Consequently we may take\nan empty model described by equation (44) as an accurate cosmological model in this\nlimit. Thus QMR yields a natural description of the beginning of time (with no physical\nsingularity) where all big bang models fail (since big bang models are not valid for t = 0).\nBut an empty beginning of the Universe means that one needs a working matter creation\nmechanism. Thus it is natural to suggest something analogous to particle creation by\nthe expansion of the Universe in traditional big bang models. That is, in the very early\nUniverse the global NKE is so strong that non-gravitational quantum ﬁelds cannot be\ntreated as localized to suﬃcient accuracy, so one should get spontaneous pair production\nfrom excitations of vacuum ﬂuctuations of such quantum ﬁelds (violating equation (25)).\nMoreover, newly created material particles should induce tiny gravitational perturbations\nwhich will grow when the Universe cools. The details of these suggestions have not been\nworked out. However, any hope that QMR may represent a complete framework for\nrelativistic physics depends on if the mathematical details of a matter creation mechanism\ncan be developed.\nEven if models of the type (44) are not accurate for the present epoch we may still\nuse it to illustrate some of the properties of a cosmological model where the expansion\nis non-kinematical. That is, the linear dependence of the scale factor on ct and the\nglobal positive curvature of space are valid predictions of any quasi-metric cosmological\nmodel, so even if a more realistic model with non-isotropic matter density does represent\na deviation from (44), we may use (44) in combination with the equations of motion to\ndeduce some general features of quasi-metric cosmology. In particular it is easy to derive\nthe usual expansion redshift of momentum for decoupled massless particle species from\n24(44). To do that, use the coordinate expression for a null path in the χ-direction as\ncalculated from (44) and the equations of motion. The result is [2]\nχ(t) = χ(t0) + ln\nt\nt0\n, (45)\nand a standard calculation using (45) yields the usual expansion redshift formula. Also\nthe corresponding time dilation follows from equation (45).\nOn the other hand the speed w of any inertial material point particle with respect to\nthe FOs is unaﬀected by the global NKE [2]. In standard cosmology, however, the eﬀect\nof cosmic expansion is that any inertial material particle will slow down over time with\nrespect to the cosmic substratum. This diﬀerence illustrates that the nature of the global\nNKE is quite diﬀerent from its kinematical counterpart in standard cosmology. But the\nconstraints on the scale factor evolution coming from primordial nucleosynthesis should\nnot depend critically on this diﬀerence though. That is, the fact that coasting universe\nmodels in metric gravity are consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis [8], indicates that\nthis consistency holds for QMR as well.\nOver the last few years a “concordance” big bang model has emerged from the ob-\nservational determination of standard cosmological parameters. Key observational con-\nstraints on these cosmological parameters mainly come from two diﬀerent types of data;\ni.e., from supernovae at cosmological distances (see the next section) and from analysis\nof temperature ﬂuctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The concor-\ndance model predicts that the Universe should be nearly spatially ﬂat and ﬁlled with\nexotic matter (“dark energy”, possibly in the form of a cosmological constant) dominat-\ning the dynamics of the Universe, causing the cosmic expansion to accelerate. Since a\nuniverse dominated by dark energy raises some rather deep (and potentially unanswer-\nable) questions concerning its nature, it could be argued that the inferred existence of the\npreposterous dark energy might be an artifact due to analyzing observational data within\nan incorrect space-time framework. To explore this possibility the CMB data should be\nreanalyzed within the quasi-metric framework. In particular this should be done for the\ndata obtained from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). These data\nshow at least one unexpected feature; namely that the temperature angular correlation\nfunction lacks power on angular scales greater than about 60◦ [9]. This may possibly have\na natural explanation within the quasi-metric framework since any quasi-metric universe\nis closed and “small”; i.e., its spatial curvature scale should represent a natural cut-oﬀ\nfor ﬂuctuations. Moreover, since no counterpart to the Friedmann equation exists in\nQMR, there are no dynamical restrictions on the data ruling out a universe with scale\nfactor close to the size of the observable Universe. This may be compared to the metric\n25framework, where a closed universe cannot be too small and have a trivial topology since\nthis will be inconsistent with the value of the Hubble parameter obtained from other,\nindependent observations (see, e.g., reference [10] for a further discussion of this point).\n4.2 QMR and type Ia supernovae\nNewtonian stars for which the equation of state takes the form p∝ργ\nm, γ > 6\n5, are called\nNewtonian polytropes [11]. In quasi-metric theory it is possible to model Newtonian\npolytropes by taking Newtonian limits of the relevant equations but such that the t-\ndependence remains. According to quasi-metric theory the cosmic expansion is predicted\nto induce hydrostatic instabilities in polytropes consisting of degenerate matter [2]. But\nif the hydrodynamical eﬀects on the gravitational ﬁeld coming from instabilities can be\nneglected, one may solve the ﬁeld equations for each epoch t assuming that the polytrope\nis at hydrostatic equilibrium. It is then possible to show [2] that the usual analysis of\nNewtonian polytropes [11] applies, but with with a variable G, i.e. G→Gt≡ t\nt0G.\nOf particular interest are Newtonian polytropes for which γ = 4\n3, since such stars\nare models for Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (WDs). From reference [11] we easily\nﬁnd that the (passive) mass mc and physical radius Lc of such WDs (with identical\ncentral mass densities) depend on epoch such that mc(t) = (\nt0\nt )3/2mc(t0) and Lc(t) =\n(\nt0\nt )1/2Lc(t0), respectively. Since Chandrasekhar mass WDs are believed to be progenitors\nof type Ia supernovae, one may expect that any cosmic evolution of Chandrasekhar\nmass WDs should imply a systematic luminosity evolution of type Ia supernovae over\ncosmic time scales. However, such a luminosity evolution would be inconsistent with\ntheir use as standard candles when determining the cosmological parameters in standard\ncosmology: luminosity evolution could have serious consequences for an interpretation of\nthe supernova data in terms of an accelerating cosmic expansion indicating a non-zero\ncosmological constant [12], [13].\nNow quasi-metric theory predicts that the cosmic expansion does neither accelerate\nnor decelerate. Moreover, according to quasi-metric theory, the Chandrasekhar mass\nvaries with epoch and this means that type Ia supernovae may be generated from cosmo-\nlogically induced collapse of progenitor WDs. But the consequences for type Ia supernova\npeak luminosities due to the predicted evolution of progenitor WDs are not clear. Since\nthe luminosity of type Ia supernovae comes from γ-disintegration of unstable nuclear\nspecies (mainly 56Ni) synthesized in the explosion, this luminosity could depend criti-\ncally on the conditions of the nuclear burn. That is, the detailed nuclear composition\nsynthesized in the explosion might depend on the local acceleration of gravity experienced\n26by the burning front (which should depend on the value of G). Other critical factors might\nbe supernova progenitor mass and chemical composition [14] (see below). Also the pres-\nence of more massive ejecta during the explosion could have an inﬂuence on supernova\nluminosities and light curves.\nThe eﬀects of a varying gravitational “constant” on type Ia supernova luminosities\nhave been studied elsewhere [15], [16]. In these papers it is assumed that the peak\nluminosity is proportional to the synthesized mass of 56Ni which again is assumed to be\nproportional to the Chandrasekhar mass. Moreover, using a toy model of the supernova\nexplosion, the dependence of the intrinsic time scale τs of the explosion on G has been\ndeduced (neglecting radioactive heating). The results are\nL(t)∝\n  G(t)\nG(t0)\n − 3\n2\n, τs(t)∝\n  G(t)\nG(t0)\n − 3\n4\n. (46)\nWe see that if both of these luminosity and intrinsic time scale evolutions were valid within\nthe quasi-metric framework, we would have been forced to deduce that L(z)∝(1 + z)\n3\n2\nand τs(z)∝(1 + z)\n3\n4. This means that, rather than intrinsically fainter, ancient super-\nnovae would have been predicted to be intrinsically brighter than today’s in addition to\ndisplaying broader light curves, contrary to observations. But it is by no means obvious\nthat the toy model yielding the above luminosity and intrinsic time scale evolutions is\nsuﬃciently realistic. Rather one should include all aspects of progenitor evolution on\ntype Ia supernovae before deducing such evolutions. In particular the amount of 56Ni\nsynthesized in the explosion and thus the supernova luminosity will depend on the C/O\nratio present in the progenitor WD. In general more massive progenitor WDs will have\nsmaller C/O ratios than less massive ones due to diﬀerent conditions in the He-burning\nstages of their progenitor stars [17]. A smaller C/O ratio implies a that a smaller per-\ncentage of 56Ni should be produced relative to other explosion products [17]. Besides, a\nsmaller C/O ratio will aﬀect the energetics of the explosion such that ejecta velocities and\nthus supernova size will be smaller at any given time after the explosion [17]. Since these\neﬀects may be important for supernova luminosity evolution, it is possible that ancient\nsupernovae in fact could be intrinsically dimmer than today’s, despite their being more\nmassive. But any investigation of this possibility requires detailed numerical simulations,\nso before such have been performed it is not possible to say whether or not the predictions\nfrom quasi-metric theory are consistent with the data.\nHowever, what we can easily do is to see if it is possible to construct a simple lumi-\nnosity evolution which, in combination with the cosmological toy model (44), yields a\nreasonable ﬁt to the supernova data. That is, we may try a luminosity evolution of the\n27source of the form\nLqmr = Lstd(\nt0\nt\n)\nǫ = Lstd(1 + z)\n−ǫ, (47)\nwhere Lstd is a ﬁxed standard luminosity, and see if the data are well ﬁtted for some\nvalue(s) of ǫ. To check this we use the postulated luminosity evolution to plot apparent\nmagnitude mqmr versus redshift for type Ia supernovae. The easiest way to compare this\nto data is to calculate the predicted diﬀerence between the quasi-metric model (with\nsource luminosity evolution) and a FRW model where the scale factor increases linearly\nwith epoch, namely the “expanding Minkowski universe” given by a piece of Minkowski\nspace-time:\nds\n2 = −(dx\n0)\n2 + (x\n0)\n2\n \ndχ\n2 + sinh\n2χdΩ\n2\n \n. (48)\nThe diﬀerence in apparent magnitude ∆m between the two models (as a function of\nredshift z) can be found by a standard calculation. The result is\n∆m≡mqmr − mmin = 2.5log10\n \nsin\n2{ln(1 + z)}\n \n−5log10\n \nsinh{ln(1 + z)}\n \n− 2.5log10\nLqmr\nLmin\n, (49)\nwhere Lqmr/Lmin represents the luminosity evolution of the source in our quasi-metric\nmodel relative to no luminosity evolution in an empty FRW model. One may then ﬁnd\nthe relation mqmr(z) from equation (49) and the relation mmin(z) graphically shown in\nreference [12], and then compare to data. One ﬁnds that the quasi-metric model is quite\nconsistent with the data for values of ǫ of about 0.5. That is, for ǫ near 0.5 ∆m has a\nmaximum at z≈0.5; for higher redshifts ∆m decreases (and eventually becomes negative\nfor z larger than about 1.2). In standard cosmology this behaviour would be interpreted\nas evidence for an era of cosmic deceleration at high z.\nWe conclude that quasi-metric cosmology combined with a simple luminosity evolution\nseems to be consistent with the data but that a much more detailed model should be\nconstructed to see if the postulated luminosity evolution has some basis in the physics of\ntype Ia supernovae.\nFrom the above we see that the assertion that type Ia supernovae can be used as stan-\ndard cosmic candles independent of cosmic evolution is a model-dependent assumption.\nBut the fact is that models for which this holds fail to explain the eﬀects of the cosmic\nexpansion seen in the solar system [5], [6]. Thus, any interpretation of the supernova\ndata indicating that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating should be met with\nsome extra skepticism.\n285 Conclusions\nIn many ways any theory of gravity compatible with the quasi-metric framework must\nbe fundamentally diﬀerent from metric theories of gravity since quasi-metric space-time\nis not modeled as a semi-Riemannian manifold. The most obvious of these diﬀerences is\nthe existence of a non-metric sector and the fact that it directly inﬂuences the equations\nof motion. This means that the existence of a non-metric sector may be inferred from\ndata on test particle motion. In fact non-metric eﬀects on test particle motion in weak\ngravitational ﬁelds can be tested against experiment rather independently of any system-\natic weak ﬁeld expansion for the metric sector. And the status so far is that it seems like\nnon-metric eﬀects are seen in good agreement with predictions [5], [6].\nThe geometrical structure of quasi-metric space-time also gives QMR some conceptual\nadvantages over metric theory. For example, the simple causal structure of QMR leaves\nno room for event horizons. Thus potential vexing questions concerning the nature of\nblack holes and space-time singularities do not exist in QMR. Besides, quasi-metric space-\ntime is constructed to yield maximal predictive power. This shows up most clearly in\ncosmology, since both the global shape and curvature of the Universe in addition to its\nexpansion history are basic features of QMR and not adjustable. This is in contrast\nto metric theory where essentially arbitrary cosmic initial conditions and a number of\ncosmological parameters are available, making it much more ﬂexible than QMR. Should\nQMR turn out to survive confrontation with cosmological observations, the vulnerability\nof QMR predictions would give strong support to QMR.\nBut even in its metric sector quasi-metric gravity is diﬀerent from those metric theo-\nries suitable for a standard PPN-analysis. The main reason for this is that quasi-metric\ngravity contains an implicit dynamical degree of freedom not coupled explicitly to matter.\nUnfortunately the lack of a weak ﬁeld expansion formalism (having some necessary corre-\nspondence with the PPN-framework) makes it harder to test the metric aspects of QMR.\nHowever, a weak ﬁeld expansion scheme is not needed to see that the geometric struc-\nture of quasi-metric space-time is consistent with no Nordtvedt eﬀect. In other words,\nthe quasi-metric theory of gravity presented in this paper should fulﬁll the Gravitational\nWeak Equivalence Principle (GWEP). In fact many experiments testing the validity of\nthe SEP actually test the GWEP. Thus the fact that QMR violates the SEP needs not\nbe fatal.\nBut there are other crucial observational tests which QMR has to survive. For ex-\nample, the nature of gravitational radiation in QMR should be worked out to see if\npredictions are compatible with observations of binary pulsars. So there is much further\n29work to be done before we can know whether or not QMR is viable. However, observa-\ntions do seem to conﬁrm the existence of a non-metric sector. This suggests that metric\ntheory is wrong so QMR sails up as a potential alternative.\nAcknowledgment\nI wish to thank Dr. K˚ are Olaussen for making a critical review of the manuscript.\nReferences\n[1] C.M.

For many quantum gravity is the quantization of the classical\ntheory of gravity. The process of quantization has been very successful for simple system\nof a small number of degrees of freedom but it also has worked for ﬁeld theories with\ninﬁnitely many degrees of freedom. All the quantum ﬁeld theories that so successfully\ndescribe microscopic physics start from classical Lagrangians that are then quantized. A\ntheory that has so far resisted attempts of this kind is general relativity although progress\nhas been made on this front (see [1–4]). It might be that we just have not ﬁgured out the\ncorrect way of performing the quantization. It might be a technical problem that has so far\nprevented us from obtaining a quantum theory of gravity via a process of quantization. On\nthe other hand it might be that the failure to quantize the theory is a hint that quantization\nis not the path to a quantum theory of gravity.\nIn condensed matter physics a diﬀerent point of view of the relation between a quantum\ntheory and its classical limit has emerged. It may happen that the degrees of freedom that\ndescribe the low energy behavior of a quantum theory are very diﬀerent from the more\nfundamental building blocks of the theory. Spin waves for example are very diﬀerent from\nthe underlying spins that give rise to them. In this case the quantum theory can not be\nobtained by quantizing the theory of the low energy degrees of freedom. What if the quantum\ntheory of gravity is of this kind? This would mean that we should not start by trying to\nconstruct a quantum theory of spacetimes. The underlying theory would not be a theory\nof quantized metrics. Instead a spacetime would only appear in the appropriate low-energy\nlimit. In this paper we will argue for just such a scenario.\nEven if we adopt this point of view there is one more choice that we have to make. We\nhave to answer the question of how gravity arises. There are two possibilities. The ﬁrst\npossibility is that gravity arises as a low energy excitation of the theory. In this possibility\ngravity is perturbative. We would look for a particle that mediates gravity, i.e. the graviton,\na zero mass spin two excitation, together with its perturbation theory. The other possibility\nis that gravity is not perturbative. We will argue in this paper that gravity is of this second\nkind.\nIn the next section we review what we consider to be the most important feature of gravity,\nnamely the equivalence principle. Gravity is diﬀerent from other forces because locally it can3\nnot be detected. We review how this feature is implemented in general relativity. We then\nargue that there is a new way of implementing the equivalence principle that does not make\nuse of a metric as general relativity does. We then show how this new look at gravity can\nbe used to calculate the gravitational constant G. We ﬁnish with a discussion and outlook.\nII. GENERAL RELATIVITY AND THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE\nGravity is diﬀerent from other forces in that locally it can be made to disappear. No local\nmeasurement can tell a freely falling observer whether there is a gravitational ﬁeld or not.\nThis is the equivalence principle. Locally all physics is as it is in Minkowski space. Gravity\nis in the way these local Minkowski spaces are connected.\nIn general relativity this is implemented as follows. A connection Γab\nc contains the\ninformation of how to get from one local Minkowski space to another. If va is a vector\nthat we want to transport to another point on a path with tangent vector wb then the\nchange of va is given by\nΓab\ncv\naw\nb. (1)\nGiven a metric gab we obtain a connection Γab\nc through\nΓab\nc =\n1\n2\ng\ncd(gdb,a + gad,b − gab,d). (2)\nThrough this connection the metric gab becomes the glue that connects the local Minkowski\nspaces. It is the new dynamical variable of the theory.\nThe behavior of the metric is now tied to the behavior of matter via Einstein’s equations:\nRab −\n1\n2\ngabR = 8πGTab (3)\nIn this language of metrics and connections the equivalence principle is expressed through\nthe fact that one can always choose a coordinate system containing a point p such that Γab\nc\nvanishes at that point. This system is the local Minkowski space without gravity. One way\nto see this is to look at the geodesic equation\n¨ w\na + Γ\na\nbcw\nbw\nc = 0. (4)\nIf the connection Γa\nbc vanishes at a point then at least in a small neighborhood of that point\na body behaves just like in Minkowski space free of gravity.4\nWe want to remark that spacetime has become dynamical but it is still a stage for matter.\nMatter is still moving on spacetime. The new feature of general relativity is that spacetime\nreacts to the presence of matter. We will come back to this point later.\nIII. THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE, AGAIN.\nIn the previous section we have seen that the equivalence principle is fundamental to\ngravity. Here we want to suggest that there is another way to implement the equivalence\nprinciple that does not rely on metrics. To do so we have to make somewhat of a detour\nthrough the theory of many-body systems. Let us begin with the simple example of an Ising\nmodel in one dimension. Its Hamiltonian is given by\nH =\nN X\ni=1\nσiσi+1. (5)\nA possible ground state of this Hamiltonian is given by\n|0  = |0...0 . (6)\nExcitations above the ground state have the form\n|k  =\nN X\nn=1\nexp\n￿\n2πi\nkn\nN\n￿\n|n , (7)\nwith\n|n  = |0...1...0 , (8)\nand the 1 occurs at the nth position. Note that the vacuum |0  is degenerate. In this case\nthe set of possible vacua V can be identiﬁed with the sphere S2:\nV = S\n2 (9)\nEach of the possible vacua has the same set of excitations. In this case these are just the\nsimple spin waves of equation (7).\nLet is now imagine an internal observer in such a system. By this we mean an observer\nwho has only access to the emergent degrees of freedom, i.e. the low-lying excitations and not\nthe spins themselves. These excitations are to the observer what elementary particles are to\nus. The point that we want to stress now is that using only these excitations it is impossible5\nfor the observer to tell in what vacuum state she happens to be in. All measurements are\nrecords of relations among excitations. An excitation is distinguished by the way it interacts\nwith other excitations. Any point in V has the same set of excitations which in turn have\nthe same interactions with each other. Thus, any point in V looks to an internal observer\njust like any other point in V. If, in particular, the excitations are such that the physics is\nas in Minkowski space then every vacuum in V gives rise to the same Minkowski space.\nIt is here that we make the connection with the equivalence principle. In gravity the\nequivalence principle states that locally we can not determine whether there is a gravitational\nﬁeld or not. By putting ourselves in an Einstein elevator gravity disappears. Locally there\nis no gravity. Gravity is in the non-trivial eﬀect that moving from one Minkowski space\nto another has. We have seen that the vacua for many-body systems provide a similar\nstructure. If instead of having just one global vacuum we have a map\nv : M −→ V (10)\nthat assigns a (possibly) diﬀerent vacuum to every point of spacetime M then locally the\nphysics would be indistinguishable from a constant vacuum but globally there are eﬀects\nbecause the map v is not constant. We claim that these eﬀects constitute gravity.\nThus instead of saying that gravity arises because we are connecting diﬀerent Minkowski\nspaces we are saying that gravity is the result of connecting diﬀerent vacua.\nIV. THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT\nWe want to explore this new view of gravity by showing how to calculate the gravitational\nconstant G. To do this let us distinguish between the gravitational mass m and the inertial\nmass m of an object. The gravitational mass m is deﬁned by Newton’s law of gravity. Two\nobjects with gravitational masses m1 and m2 attract each other with the force\nF =\nm1m2\nr2 , (11)\nwhere r is the distance between the two masses. This is not the way we usually write\nNewton’s law. Instead of using the gravitational masses mi, i = 1,2, we use the inertial\nmasses mi, i = 1,2. Whereas the gravitational mass is about the gravitational force between\ntwo masses, the inertial mass is about how hard it is to change the state of motion of one6\nmass alone. It is a remarkable experimental fact that there is a constant C such that\nm = Cm. (12)\nWe can thus write Newton’s law of gravity in terms of the inertial masses:\nF = G\nm1m2\nr2 , (13)\nwhere G is Newton’s gravitational constant. Comparing the two expressions for Newton’s\nlaw we see that\nG = C\n−2. (14)\nTo ﬁnd Newton’s constant we thus have to calculate the constant C that relates the gravi-\ntational mass m to the inertial mass m of an object.\nLet us begin by obtaining an expression for the inertial mass of an object (see [5] for more\ndetails). For simplicity let us assume that V is just parametrized by one scalar parameter\nθ. Let us also assume that far away from any excitations the system is in the ground state\nθ0. Excitations are then deviations δθ from the ground state θ0. We can then go one step\nfurther and let these excitations form bound states. It is the gravitational mass m of such\na bound states that we want to determine.\nAway from the bound state the vacuum is approximately θ0. The farther away we go\nfrom the bound state the better the approximation. Next to the bound state though the\nsituation has to be diﬀerent. Because the bound state is made up out of excitations and the\nexcitations are themselves deviations from θ0 the vacuum next to the bound state can not\nbe θ0. As we will see it is this deviation that gives rise to gravity. Let us assume that there\nis a term in the Hamiltonian of the form\n1\n8π\nZ\nd\n3x (∇θ)\n2. (15)\n(the factor of 1/8π is included here for future convenience). A term like this tries to suppress\ndeviations from θ0. It also is responsible for the motion of the excitations. Because of this\nterm and because the presence of a bound state changes the vacuum there will be a force\nbetween any two bound states. This is easily seen by analogy with electrostatics. If we\nreplace θ with φ, the electric potential, equation (15) becomes the energy of the electric\nﬁeld. From this energy we can obtain the force between two bound states by diﬀerentiating7\nwith respect to the position of one of the masses. As in electrostatics we obtain the force\nF =\nm1m2\nr2 , (16)\nif we deﬁne the masses (i.e. the charges) by\nmi =\n1\n4π\nZ\n∂mi\ndσ · ∇θ, i = 1,2. (17)\nHere ∂mi is the boundary of the bound state i.\nTo ﬁnd the inertial mass we now make an assumption about the momentum of a moving\nmass. We do this by taking the analogy with electromagnetism one step further. The\nmomentum of a moving spherical shell with radius a and charge q is given by [6]\np =\n2\n3\nq2\na\nγv, (18)\nwhere γ =\n√\n1 + v2. For small velocities v the factor γ is roughly unity and we obtain\np =\n2\n3\nq2\na\nv. (19)\nWe now assume that our system behaves in the same way as electrodynamics. Thus we\nassume that the momentum of the moving mass is given by\np =\n2\n3\nm2\na\nv (20)\nHere a is now the linear extension of the bound state that we are looking at. To read oﬀ\nthe expression for the inertial mass we rewrite this equation as follows:\np =\n2\n3\nm\na\nmv (21)\nThe whole expression multiplying the velocity v is equal to the inertial mass m. Thus\nm =\n2m\n3a\nm, (22)\nand the constant C that relates the inertial and the gravitational mass is given by\nC =\n2m\n3a\n. (23)\nFrom equation (14) we then ﬁnd the gravitational constant G:\nG =\n￿\n3a\n2m\n￿2\n(24)\nThe strange factors of two and three appear here because we used the expression for the\nmomentum of a charged shell. The details diﬀer if another charge distribution is used instead\nbut are always of order unity.8\nV. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\nWhat is quantum gravity? This is the question that started this paper. The usual\nanswer is that quantum gravity it the quantization of general relativity, the classical theory\nof gravity. Quantum gravity is thus a quantum theory of spacetimes. The technical question\nthat one has to tackle is how to construct a theory of superpositions of spacetimes. This has\nproven diﬃcult for conceptual as well as mathematical reasons. We have argued here that\nquantum gravity is very diﬀerent from a theory of quantized metrics. First we have argued\nthat gravity is not part of the fundamental theory but instead is an emergent feature of the\nlow-energy theory. Then we have argued that gravity is not an excitation of the theory but\na non-perturbative feature. Gravity is due to the spatially changing vacuum of the theory.\nPeople have looked at emergent theories of gravity for a while (see [7] for a recent review).\nOur approach is new in that we do not aim at deriving Einstein’s equation from our setup.\nInstead of arguing that gravity is about metrics and that the aim of an emergent theory\nof gravity should be to derive Einstein’s theory as the low-energy emergent theory we say\nthat gravity is not about metrics at all. Instead it is about how the vacuum reacts to the\npresence of excitations of this vacuum. This is the really new feature of our theory. No more\nspacetimes.\nOne appealing aspect of our setup that is, that there is no need for a quantization of\nthe theory. Since we start from a quantum theory, no quantization required. This is much\nlike theories in solid state physics. Instead of starting with classical theory that needs to be\nquantized, one usually starts from a theory expressed in terms of simple quantum systems\ninstead. Together with a Hamiltonian expressing the interaction of these quantum systems,\nthis provides the complete description of the system. The hard part is then is then to ﬁnd\nthe low-energy behavior of this theory. Quantization never enters the picture.\nWe think that this relation between the classical limit and the underlying quantum theory\nis as it should be. The idea that the more fundamental quantum theory is the quantization\nof the emergent classical theory always struck us as an unlikely scenario.\nWe have shown how this new view of gravity can be used to calculate the gravitational\nconstant G from the underlying theory. We did this by deriving expressions for the gravi-\ntational and the inertial mass of an object. It is here that most of the questions about the\ntheory arise. How much of an assumption about the underlying theory is made in equa-9\ntions (17) and (22)? Also more work is required in analyzing what the exact status of the\nequivalence principle is in our theory. We have motivated our approach by appealing to the\nequivalence principle but it seems that it is conceivable that the expression that we have\nfound for the gravitational constant is not universal and might vary from one particle species\nto another. It also might be dependent on the energy of the particles. All these questions\nwill be analyzed in future work.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Seth Lloyd for all the help he has provided both scientiﬁcally and\nprivately.

Preamble\nThe present article aims to present two important ideas in the context of a general con-\nceptual framework called Quantum Relativity, which is the “space-time oriented” companion\nof Quantum Information Dynamics:\n1) The unifying gauge “group” is the qubit, viewed as the Hopf monopole bundle:\nSU(1) ∼ = S\n1 → SU(2) ∼ = S\n3 → S\n2;\n2) “Gravity” is a deformation of Electromagnetism.\nTherefore in the context of the discrete background independent Quantum Information\nDynamics, it is already a “quantum” theory.\nThe focus will be on the physics interface, supported by mathematical ideas from defor-\nmation theory.\nThere will be no details nor ﬁnal formulas, since the present approach is tentative at\nthis stage, occasionally presenting conﬂicting alternatives as part of the quantum gravity\n“puzzle” ...\nInstead, the author hopes that the reader will be interested in pursuing some of the\nquestions raised directly or, quite often indirectly, through claims based on intuition.\n2. Introduction\nFrom a Computer Science point of view of Mathematical-Physics a new paradigm emerges:\nQuantum Information Dynamics [19]. It is the mathematical-physics component of the\nDigital World Theory [16], providing a unifying framework for both classical and quantum\nphysics, based on graph complexes and their cohomology [31, 7, 17, 10].QUANTUM RELATIVITY 3\nThe main point is that the role of Electromagnetism was underestimated, even after the\nremarkable discovery of Aharonov-Bohm a. a. of the close connection between quantum\nphase and classical EM as a SU1-gauge theory.\nA closer inspection of Special Relativity reveals that not only time is not “absolute” as\na conclusion of a Einstein’s critical analysis of the concept of synchronization, but also\nthe concept of “direction” (parallelism) is subject to the same criticism. Therefore an SO3-\nconnection is mandatory to make sense of “direction correlation”; the assumption of a metric\nwith its induced Levi-Civita connection is clearly an extra assumption, no longer appropriate\nin a modern physics dominated by quantum theory.\nIn conclusion [19], EM as a SU1-gauge theory is only a Hopf “ﬁber” of QID as a SU2-Yang-\nMills theory on whatever “space” is. The author claims that “space” should be a model for\nthe structure of matter, preferably a dynamical lattice, as argued in [16], and “time” per se,\nwith physical meaning is not one dimensional, since it should model the change of structure,\npreferably as a cobordism 1.\nThis yields a nice Background Space-Time Independent Theory (BIT), from which Quan-\ntum Mechanics (QM) emerges, with Heisenberg “uncertainty relations” as its trademark\ndue to an averaging over possible space-time coordinate systems, which are embedding in an\nambient space-time manifold as in String Theory.\nFrom QID also Quantum Field Theory emerges, with its Feynman diagrams and variable\nnumber of particles trademark, when taking full advantage of graph homology and loop\nderivative, as in Loop Quantum Gravity.\nWhen we say “emerges”, we mean that a reasonably simple interface exists between the two\ntheories (conceptual level), allowing to incorporate the results of one theory into the other,\nas if it would be a “plug-in”, once the diﬀerences of languages used for their implementations\nare identiﬁed.\nBut then, why is there a “Gravity” to “spoil” this nice picture?\nIn this article we will (try) to prove that “Gravity” is a perturbation of “Electromagnetism”\n(EM), related to the standard bialgebra deformation technique from quantization 2.\nAlthough the “bigger picture” seems to indicate that the “speed of light” is in fact an\nisomorphism (with four eigenvalues) corresponding to a family of deformations of Hodge\nduality, probably dual to Dirac quantization at the level of inﬁnitesimal symmetries:\nF(G)c × U(g)h → C,\nwe will restrict our attention to deforming Special Relativity.\nIndeed, Lorentz group is a one-parameter inﬁnitesimal deformation of Galilei group. In\nview of General Relativity, it represents the local symmetries of physical processes (classical\nor quantum). Therefore we believe that one needs to deform Galilei group, not to “quantize”\nGeneral Relativity! As hinted above, we claim that “quantization” comes for free, from the\ndiscretization process and categorical approach 3.\n1Categorical approach: systems/objects, processes/morphism.\n2Quotations are in order since there are also various versions of EM.\n3What “is” and its “change” do not commute as in pointwise physics.4 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\nThe byproduct of deformation of symmetries, via Noether Theorem and Euler-Lagrange\nEquations, should be a “deformed Lorentz force”, incorporating a gravitational attraction\nterm.\nAgain, once the local picture is taken care of, the global picture is the result of applying the\nhomological algebra machinery: classical information (external space) as a lattice (chains),\n“time” as cobordisms, quantum information modeled via SU2-coeﬃcients as internal space,\nand the emergence of classical properties from quantum ones via measurement bases, as well\nas entanglement due to feedback loops, a consequence oﬀ graph (cobordism) extentions and\ninternal-external cohomological duality (IE-duality) [19].\nThe next section is devoted to the fundamental correspondence Quantum Computing -\nSpecial Relativity, used also as a starting point in twistor theory.\nSection §3 investigates Newton’s law of the gravitational force as a perturbation of the\nelectric force.\nSince the “issue” is not resolved in such a straightforward manner, alternative “mathe-\nmatical guns” are thrown into the battle.\nThe concluding section is a preview of the program for developing the new paradigm in\nphysics [19]: QID, and its relations with existing directions of research, notably with String\nTheory.\nThe background together with the technical material are conﬁned to the Annex.\n3. Quantum Computing Model of Special Relativity\nThere is a correspondence between the Quantum Computing model, modeling the ﬂow of\nqubits through the quantum gates of a Quantum Netqork (Q-Net) [51], and the Minkowski\nspace R3,1 with its Lorentz/Poincare symmetries.\nIt can be traced to the Klein correspondence with its physical interpretation in Twistor\nTheory [15].\nIt will be denoted by QC ∼ = SR, and hinted to by 2+2 ∼ = 3+1 (level of dimensions). It is\nalso referred to as the Hermitian Model of SR, since to a 4-vector it associates a hermitian\nmatrix.\n3.1. SL2(C) and quaternions. Quaternions, as a division algebra, can be viewed as the\nresult of a double construction, analogous to the construction of complex numbers:\nH = C ⊕ C\n∗,J : H → H,J\n2 = −1.\nHere the dual of C has conjugate vector space structure, so J is equivalent to a complex\nconjugate linear map C → C.\nIt is in fact a generalized complex structure (GCS) [12].\nConjugation by non-zero quaternions C : H× → Aut(H), with kernel R× =< 1 >×,\ninduces the polar decomposition:\nZ(H) = R → H → g = (R\n3,×). (1)\nHere g is the angular velocity Lie algebra with cross-product as a Lie bracket.QUANTUM RELATIVITY 5\nThe group of unit norm quaternions is SU2. Under Exponentiation of the ad-action:\ng\nAd // Aut(g) x  → adx\nSL2(C)\nC // Aut(SU2)\nyields the action of SL2(C) on SU2 by conjugation on itself by rotations SO3 [28]:\nadω(v) = ω × v.\nAs a central extension of the Lie algebra g, it is associated to a 2-cocycle related to the\nEinstein addition of velocities. It will be called the QC/SR central extension.\nAt the level of groups we have the following short exact sequence of 2:1 covering maps:\nSU2\n2:1\n￿￿\n// SL2(C)\n2:1\n￿￿\nSO3 // SO(3,1)+.\n3.2. Hermitian model. It induces a correspondence between hermitan matrices ξ and\nquadri-vectors u = (x,y,z,ct) ∈ M3,1 of Minkowski space:\nH ∋ ξ =\n￿\nz − ct x − iy\nx + iy z + ct\n￿\n.\nThe conformal structure [48] corresponds to the Minkowski norm:\ndet(ξ) = ||u||\n2.\n3.3. Wick isomorphism. sl2(C) has two isomorphic real forms sl2(R) and su2 (real struc-\nture constants):\nsl2(R) : [K\n+,K\n−] = S,[K\n±,S] = ±S su2 : [Jx,Jy] = Jz (cyclic),\nnote also su2 ∼ = so3 (σx etc. are Pauli matrices):\niσx  → Jx etc.\nand su2 ⊗ C ∼ = sl2(C).\nA real vector space isomorphism can be deﬁned in terms of canonical bases (compare with\n[29], p.47):\nWR : sl2(R) → su2, K\n±  → σx ± iσy, S  → σz,\ncalled Wick rotation.\nThen sl2(C) can be viewed as g ⊕ g∗, since su2 ∼ = so3, with so∗\n3 the angular momentum\nLie algebra (dual to g).\nSo sl2(C) has a canonical generalized complex structure, determined by the Wick rotation\nJ : sl2(C) → sl2(C).\nThe real Re(ξ) of a traceless matrix is the projection on the non-compact form sl2(R), and\nthe imaginary part is the projection on the compact form su2.6 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\n3.4. The Lorentz 2-cocycle. The QC/SR central extension determines an inﬁnitesimal\ndeformation of the Lie algebra (g,×) with deformation parameter c. Since later we will fully\ndeform g, we view the “speed of light” as a formal parameter h = 1/c\nu = ct +  v, u/c = t +  vh + ... .\nIn fact the four-speed of light quadri-vector c consists in the eigenvalues of the Hodge du-\nality isomorphism (c2 = 1/ ǫ), and therefore we in fact deform the duality, as we should\nwhen using the machinery of bialgebra deformation (“quantization”). The relations between\nfundamental constants, interpreted as topological generators (periods):\ngm = h/(e/c), ge = e/c, h = gmge, α = gm/ge,\ntogether with the duality between the two deformation parameters h = 1/c and h:\nh   1/c = α(e/c)\n2,\nwill be addressed elsewhere.\nHere we only aim to ﬁnd a possible relation between Newton’s gravitational constant and\nthe above “fundamental” “constants” (The term “constants” refers to the periods, not to the\n“running constants” which involve the 2-cocycle which makes them variable with energy, like\nrelativistic mass, electric charge/ﬁne structure constant etc. [14]; the periods are in some\nsense the “rest” values: Lie generators/Hopf primitives).\nReturning to the QC/SR central extension of the angular velocity Lie algebra\nZ(H) → (H,[,])\nπ → (g,×)\nwhere [q,q′] = π(q) × π(q′) since quaternionic product is\n(t,v)(t\n′,v\n′) = tt\n′ − v   v\n′ + v × v\n′.\nNote that 3D-vectors are interpreted as velocities (elements of the angular velocity Lie algebra\ng), rather then position vectors.\nNow consider the exponential:\nexp : H ⊂ sl2(C) → SU2 ⊂ SL2(C).\nRecall that conjugation by SL2(C) invaries SU2.\nLet γ : g → H be the trivial section γ(v) = v.\nThe Einstein velocity addition for parallel velocities [47] reduces for parallel boosts to an\nassociative and commutative group operation:\nu ⊕ v =\nu/c + v/c\n1 + u/c   v/c\nThere is an associated 2-cocycle\nF(u,v) = γ(u ⊕ v)/(γ(u)γ(v)).\nWe claim that ⊕ is an inﬁnitesimal deformation of the Lie algebra g addition of velocities\nthrough the logarithm:\nu ⊕ v = u + v + ...\nand will be addressed later on.QUANTUM RELATIVITY 7\n3.5. Time and projective space. “Time” is a parameter for labeling change. In mechanics\n“change” occurs in the direction of “motion”. So “time” is associated to change in the radial\ndirection of motion. A better adapted model of motion is polar decomposition:\nR\n3x = S\n2 × R+.\nWith the hidden quantum phase, the role of velocity is that of de Broglie wave vector   k, i.e.\nrather an angular velocity vector (element of g).\nIn QID “motion” is a change of angles (direction correlation) and radial distance (resistence\nto interaction, or its inverse, capacity of interaction).\nThe 2-cocycle of SR corresponds to a central extension associated to a projective rep-\nresentation. This in turn comes from a representation at the level of projective space as a\nhomogeneous space. It is the base of the Hopf monopole bundle, the qubit model of the atom:\nS\n1 → S\n3 → S\n2 SU1 → SU2 → S\n2.\nIn passing we mention that this CS-point of view suggests to take the Hopf bundles (monopole\nand instanton) as the “unifying gauge group” of all interactions [19] (SU3 comes for “free”).\nMore precisely S2 = CP 1, MT = Aut(CP 1) = PSL2(C):\nξ(z1 : z2\n∗) = (ξz1 : ξ\n∗z\n∗\n2).\n4. The Contraction Lorentz to Galilei\nThe homogeneous Galilei group is the contraction c → ∞ of the Lorentz group [29].\na more general setup is the Anti-de Sitter group as a 2-parameter deformation of Galilei\ngroup [5].\n4.1. Galilei group. The Galilei group is the Klein group of the homogeneous space R3, a\nsemi-direct product\nRot × Translations\n. As a Klein geometry (kinematics) it is better to view translations as discrete displacements\nwith velocity v, i.e. as an aﬃne space / groupoid:\nGal : {A → B}.\nWithout spin there is no angular velocity interpretation, so no (Lie) curvature.\nNow abandon the classical and deterministic “pointwise physics” and adopt a “bilo-\ncal physics” of interactions (quantum mechanics, Cramer’s tranzactional interpretation,\nFeynman-Wheeler theory, Aharonov-Vaidman bistates quantum mechanics etc.).\nTranslations are banished, every transformation becomes a two ﬁxed point rotation (Feyn-\nman paths: I/O-transformations) and space-time is “compactiﬁed” as a category of systems\nand processes morphying one system into another (time as cobordisms).\nAt mathematics level this invites conformal geometry, and at our local model, Moebus\ntransformations (MT). Think that such a MT corresponds to two Bloch vectors (four points:\n0,A,∞,A′): the “dumbbell picture” of QC (instanton Hopf bundle).\nWick isomorphism allows to transport the Lie bracket into a cobracket on g∗, yielding a\nbialgebra structure on sl2(C). With such a Poisson-Lie structure, one can apply the quantum\ndouble construction.8 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\n4.2. Lorentz force. It can be viewed as part of Euler-Lagrange equation.\nThe magnetic term v × B can be interpreted as a rotation: Omega(v).\nThe Euler equation for G/g is [29]:\n˙ Ω = ad\n∗\nvΩ, v ∈ g.\nTo understand Gravity as a deformation of EM, consider the whole picture in terms of\ncanonical momentum P = mv + eA versus netwon’s picture separate from Lorentz force:\nd(mv)/dt = q(E + v × B).\nAlso do not separate particles from ﬁelds, as in “pointwise physics”; rather consider the\ncategorical interaction picture (“bilocal physics”).\nd(mredv) = GNmm\n′/r\n2 + keqq\n′/r\n2 + qq\n′v × B/q\n′.\nhere mred is the reduced mass:\n2/mred = 1/m + 1/m\n′.\nIf\nmc\n2 = τ\n2, R = logτ\n“resistance to change” adds up in “parallel”.\nThis point of view leads to a reinterpretation of Bio-Savart Law as a Gaussian Link; in\nthis sense, as Descartes was saying, every motion is a rotation ...\nSo q,q′ are indexes (winding numbers/Chern classes of the two Hopf bundles) and m,m′\nare associated to the corresponding momentum maps (Hamiltonian circle reduction inter-\npretation of the qubit as a harmonic oscillator [19]).\n5. SL2(C)-Gravity\nWe essentially deform SL2(C)-gravity, except we consider Einstein’s equations of General\nRelativity as expressing a local constraint. It is the curvature of a reductive Lie group:\nRic + Killing/4 = 0.\nWhen “adding” homology (Q-net chain / QI cochain cohomology with SU2-coeﬃcients), one\nobtains a non-homogeneous version with a topological RHS which represents matter via 1,2\nand 3-periods (ﬂuxons, e/m-charges and spin/action [27, 37, 11, 39]).\nSo the present goal is to justify Newton’s law for Gravity and the associated constant.\nThe parallel between Newton’s constant GN and Coulomb’s constant ke clearly indicates\nthat this requires uniﬁcation of internal and external DOF IE-duality [16]), which locally is\nexpressed by the GCS of sl2(C) (Wick isomorphism):\n∂L\n∂ ˙ r\n= P = mv + eA ↔ Wicki : sl2(R) → su2.\nhere A should be the SU2-yang-Mills connection, as an obvious “upgrade” of EM (it should\nyield “quark” DOFs for free; see also [39]).QUANTUM RELATIVITY 9\n5.1. Relation with Higgs mechanism. The breaking of symmetry approach to mass [50]\nshould be adapted to the grand unifying Hopf bundle picture and its associated Gysen\nsequence.\nIn view of Stashef’s cohomological physics and [17], it would not be a surprise to ﬁnd\nthat the connecting homomorphism couples EM and Gravity. In the homological algebra\nformulation of QID interactions should emerge as derived functors of the action (number of\naction quanta/entropy and harmonics/ﬂuxons).\n5.2. Quantum gravity. So we could say that gravity is “induced” as a “quantum pertur-\nbation”, if we compare our approach with the Shacarov’s induced gravity.\nIn fact in QID the Q-net (matter with its classical properties dependent on a space-time\ncoordinate system) emerges dynamically as classical information from internal QI, under\nIE-(cohomological) duality.\nGravity does not emerge as in [49] but rather as a “non-linear” (or rather non-commutative)\neﬀect; it is the result of deformation via an exponentiation process, to be explained next,\nbeing in some sense “quantum”.\n5.3. Mass and electric charge. We have focused on gravity, but what is electric charge,\nand why is it diﬀerent from mass as a source of “forces” (interactions)?\nTo address this issue we critically review Newton’s law of gravity, with hindsight from\nelectromagnetism.\nFirst, we should acknowledge that interactions are relational, so if two systems S1 and S2\nhave parts (subsystems), then if the separation distance is large compared to the internal\nsubstructure, then then the mutual interaction is well modeled by a bipartite graph:\nF12 =\nX\nij\nFij ≈ N1N2F,\nwhere F is a typical pair of interacting particles. So in a typical Coulomb law, associated\nto Newton’s law ma = F, LHS will contain a mass coeﬃcient due to system S1, but in the\nforce term in the RHS will be proportional to the products M1M2 and q1q2 (we disregard\nspin at this time):\nM1r\n′′ = Coef.f(M1,M2;q1,q2)/r\n2.\nIn fact the essence is the potential of an interacting pair of particle:\nV12 = Charge1 × Charge2 × Conductivity.\nHere “space” conductivity is 1/r, i.e. distance is “resistance” to transfer of momentum-\nenergy (interactions). The charges are weights corresponding to the types of particles, via\ntheir symmetries (gauge group, Noether theorem). They are in fact the coupling constants,\nsince the total charges are mathematically speaking dimensions or indexes (absolute or net\ncharges, like mass and electric charge).\nSince we know matter is discrete and mass and charge are additive, we can reduce the\nglobal low of interaction to the case of a pair of elementary “particles”. But there is only\none: the qubit / Hopf bundle; the electron corresponds to S1 and proton corresponds to S2.10 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\nAssume that some electrons are “separated” from the protons, by having elongated orbitals\nshared by the two systems. Let mi\n± denote the mass of protons and electrons in the two\nsystems:\nmi = m\ni\n+ + m\ni\n−, qi = m\ni\n+ − m\ni\n−.\nAt a fundamental level, if all known forces are diﬀerent aspects of one interaction, one cannot\ndistinguish between gravity and electricity, except by an approximation process. So, in the\nbasic Coulomb law for our two types of interacting particles, protons and electrons with\nmasses m+ and m−, let us introduce distinct Coulomb constants for positive and negative\ncharges:\nK+ = k + δ,K− = −k, m±r\n′′ = K±e\n2/r\n2,\nwhere e denotes the MKS unit of electric charge.\nThen the force between two neutral H-atoms, i.e. two qubits with preserved SU1-electron\nsymmetry, is the result of four interaction terms, corresponding to all possible combinations\nof signs:\nG = (K+ + K−)\n2 = δ\n2.\nWe claim that the hypothesis that G is Newton’s gravitational constant is worth pursuing,\neven in the context of the well known precision experiments which claim that e+ = e−;\nexperiments are always “theory dependent”, and sometimes the theory might suggest the\nexperiment which rules out new eﬀects not derivable from the given theory.\nThe underlying idea is that ultimately electric charge is a 2-period (integer) [37, 27, 21],\nand the coupling constant is chiral, since the Hopf bundle is. In other words, gravity is due\nto parity violation, which in turn, via Dirac’s equation interpreted in terms of QID, is a\ntopological fact about the Hopf bundle. The “rest” is achieved through deformation theory.\nAt this stage it is not clear if this has to do with the speed of light as a 2nd deformation\nparameter, but it deﬁnitely is related to the absence of right handed neutrinos (see Dirac\nequation and Weyl spinors).\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to investigate if mass is an un-oriented version of charge,\nwhile the electric charge an oriented version, both related to the 2:1 covering SU2 → SO3,\nderived from the Hopf bundle as a unifying “gauge group” and concept: the building block of\nthe universe, the hydrogen atom is modeled as the qubit, the unit of QI, which in turn is the\nHopf bundle, with its multiple roles of harmonic oscillator (Hamiltonian reduction) or local\nLorentz symmetries of “space-time”. This double function is related to the “amazing duality”\n[1] by conformal inversion between the harmonic oscillator and Kepler’s problem: uniﬁcation\nof macro and micro-cosmos (Einstein equations would appear locally as the fundamental\nequation of curvature in a symmetric space Ricc + Killing/4 = 0).\nAdditional arguments regarding the relation between mass and electric charge will be\npresented later on, in connection with the possible meaning of the vector potential of EM.\n5.4. Chirality and bialgebra deformation. Now at a technical mathematical level, de-\nformation of EM due to the chirality of the Hopf bundle (Gysen sequence) is similar to the\ndeformation of universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra (quantum groups), which can\nbe implemented via BCH-formula. This in turn corresponds to a pull-back of the non-linear\ngroup law at the level of the Lie algebra (generators of symmetry, e.g. Lorentz/PoincareQUANTUM RELATIVITY 11\nLie algebra), which corresponds to the Birkhoﬀ decomposition of the Poisson-Lie group (R-\nmatrix and all that [6]). From this angle one can say that the Birkhoﬀ decomposition of\nSU2-Yang-Mills yields the gravitational force as a residual Electromagnetic force:\nFG = F\n+\nEM − F\n−\nEM.\nBut at the level of the charge multiplicative RHS of Newton’s equation, the gravitational\nconstant could conceivably be related to the exponential of another universal constant, which\ncannot be other then the ﬁne structure constant:\nexp(−1/α) ≈ 10\n−59, G ≈ 10\n−38.\nLooking for additional conﬁrmations, we will brieﬂy speculate on the meaning of the funda-\nmental constants. We are looking for relations between fundamental constants, correspond-\ning to conceptual aspects; we are not looking for numerical coincidences.\n6. On Fundamental Constants\nBy now there is ample evidence that not only action is quantized (Plank-Einstein), but\nalso magnetic ﬂux and electric charge (ﬂuxons): Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect, quantum Hall and\nJosephson eﬀects, supraconductivity and Abrikosov lattice (vortex ﬁlaments), vorticity of\nsuperﬂuid helium.\nThese quantities were interpreted as periods [37, 27]:\n1 − periods : fluxons h/e,\n2 − periods : charge e,\n3 − periods : action h.\nFrom the “mechanical side” of superﬂuids [13, 32] another quantum appears: h/m. Since\nwhat is really conserved is the canonical momentum P = mv + qA, where A denotes the\nEM-vector potential, this is no surprise. In order to understand fundamental constants we\nneed to better understand the meaning of the vector potential.\n6.1. EM-vector potential as a transfer velocity. The vector potential (VP) was origi-\nnally interpreted by Maxwell as momentum per unit of charge [30] (see also [33]).\nWe go further and interpret it as a transfer velocity, with the following justiﬁcation.\nIn a BIT the emphasis is on interactions of pair of systems, without the usual separation\nbetween particles and felds:\nPointwise physics : • →, Interaction Physics : • → •.\nThere is an obvious trend towards such a “bilocal physics”: Feynman-Wheeler theory,\nCramer’s transactional interpretation, Aharonov-Vaideman two-states quantum mechanics\netc., not to mention “categoriﬁcation of physics” (Stasheﬀ) and the hidden compactiﬁcation\nin QM via projectivisation.\nIn order to see the impact on EM, let’s rewrite Biot-Savart law in terms of velocities of\nthe two particles involved (er = r/|r|):\nFB = kq1q2(v1/r) × ((v2/r) × er).12 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\nthe 1/r2-coulombian factor should be distributed to both particles, showing that in some\nsense the interaction is a linking number involving the relative “angular momentum” of the\ntwo particles:\nFB ∼ ω1 × (ω2 × er)).\nThis does justice to the Neumann mutual potential as the fundamental ingredient of EM as\nan interaction theory without a background space-time (and in the spirit of String Theory,\nif abstracting it from a particular embedding; so, physics is conformal after all!).\nRecalling that the VP is related to current and velocity as in:\nA =  /r qv, (continuum : J = ρv),\nthen canonical momentum of a particle S1 interacting with a 2nd particle S2 becomes:\nP12 = m1v1 +  /r q1q2v2.\nHere we have discarded gravity, to focus on the idea of velocity transfer, as a legitime version\nof the “ether dragging” theory (dark matter etc.).\nRecalling Mach’s viewpoint of relativity, the VP A1 ∼ v2, which in fact is related to the\nEM connection 1-form, represents the “correction” of the meaning of direction of v1 due to\nthe existence of the 2-nd system; “space”, as position and direction, is a collective entity due\nto the presence of matter, as learned from Einstein’s GR.\nThere are other notable sources supporting this important point: 1) QFT and collapsing\na subgraph: what is then the “average space”? 2) Cosmology: the Black-hole information\nparadox. The solution is the IE-duality [16].\nSo, as a provisional conclusion, interpret A as a transfer velocity of particle 2 “correcting”\nthe “proper space” of particle 1; of course, modulo the conversion of units to be discussed\nin the next section.\nNotice though, that in view of Descartes point of view and Maxwell’s original point of\nview [41], the alternative is to interpret qA (the VP) as a transfered angular momentum:\nP12 = m1v1 +  q1q2ω2, ω2 = er × (v2/r),\nwith a typical VP due to the 2nd charge moving with velocity v2 at r given by:\nA(r) =  /r v × er, er = r/|r|.\nRegarding IE-duality, cosmic censure-ship etc., there is a need to rewrite mechanics from\nits current two tiers: point-mechanics, body-mechanics, very reasonable hierarchy when ac-\ncepting the continuum of space and matter, in to a Mechanics incorporating hierarchy of\nstructure (resolutions), via IE-duality, which automatically would unite it with thermody-\nnamics, including entropy aspects.\nIn this vein, a system is modeled as having external parameters mass, charge and spin\n(angular momentum), corresponding to internal states “hidden” from the external classical\nworld (C/QI dichotomy), as it was naturally arived at in cosmology (Kerr black-holes etc.).\nTherefore we take as a working hypothesis that mass measures circulation at a fundamental\nlevel:\nExternal circulation : h/m, Internal circulation(fluxon) : h/e.QUANTUM RELATIVITY 13\nThis could corresponds to breaking the symmetry of (splitting) the Hopf bundle:\nS\n1 → S\n3 → S\n2.\nThink of “free” electron and protons as S1 and S2, with their cohomological 2-period e and\n1-period m.\nThis would justify to explore the idea of charge as a 2:1 version of mass (SU2 → SO3), as\nwe proposed above (m± etc.).\n6.2. The Hodge structure and its deformations. Bialgebra deformation quantization\nrelies on an “gluing isomorphism” (r-matrix), which is similar to Hodge structure.\nTo understand better the relation between the continuum approach to physics via say\nLagrangian manifolds and the discrete approach, recall the general framework of QID:\nSL2(C)-cohomology of a dg-coalgebra of graph cobordisms (“2-graphs”). At chain/homology\nlevel we have closed and exact cycles (bounded by a “surface”; vorticity etc.), and cocy-\ncles/cohomology (currents, potentials etc.).\nThe Hodge structure and decomposition on graphs is the best substitute for a “space-\ntime” decomposition/signature, and at the level of chains is related cut-cycles decomposition\n(spanning tree etc.).\nAt cohomological level it implements the constitutive relations of say EM:\nD = ǫE, H = 1/ B, ǫ  = 1/c\n2.\nIt is interpreted by some authors as a “gauge condition” [37, 27], but it is really an additional\nstructure, reducing the symmetry group. It is a compatibility condition similar to the one\ndeﬁning bialgebras via r-matrices or Frobenius algebras etc.; it is part of the duality.\nLet’s follow [37] and consider χ : λ2 → λ2 the middle dimension isomorphism G = ∗F,\nwhere F = dA = (E,B) (forms/vectors, if provided with a metric Hodge duality), and\nG = (D,H) (= d∗J?). In a diagonal form:\nχ = diag[−ǫ I3,1/  I3].\nIts invariants are:\nHall impedence : Z1 = −det(χ)\n1/3 = ǫ/ ,\nGravity : Z0 = 1/3 Tr(χ) = 1/  − ǫ.\nThe “units problem” is ignored for the moment.\nNow to keep track of the meaning corresponding to the continuum theories, recall that\nin the lagrangian formalism ∂2L/∂pi∂pj has the role of metric, or, if looking at the Euler-\nLagrange equation, that of the masses matrix.\nIn the Hermitian Model (QC∼ =SR), a qubit/spinor corresponds to a Minkovski 4-vector:\ndet(Q) = ||(ct,x,y,z)||.\nThe metric/mass relation as in GR, is related to the constitutive relations (“material”/matter),\nsay as in:\nds\n2 = ǫ dr\n2 − 1/  dt\n2, (c\n2 = 1/ǫ ).\nOf course in GR c is not and invariant, and in fact in optical physics we have 4-light velocities\nmaterial dependent [27].14 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\nHodge structure deformation is reminiscent of GR deformation of metric due to matter.\nWe will suggest this correspondence via the trademark solution of GR, the Schwartzschild\nmetric:\nds\n2 = dr\n2/(1 − rS/r) − (1 − rS/r)dt\n2, rS = Gm/c\n2\nǫ = ǫ0(1 + rS/r),  =  0(1 + rS/r).\nThey are equivalent at ﬁrst order of approximation.\nNow we return to the cohomological relations between periods, which should be due to\nthe fundamental unit, the qubit/Hopf bundle:\nExt Int\n1 − period : h/m h/e\n2 − period : m e\n3 − period : h.\nThe IE-duality prompts for a “symmetrization” of the table, taking h = 1/c, the 2nd de-\nformation parameter (besides Plank’s “constant” h), as mass-related/external (deformation\nof Lorentz/Poincare symmetry group: Anti-de Sitter group SO(3,2); corresponding in QC\nwith SU(2,2)).\nThe relations between “fundamental constants” should reﬂect the relations between gen-\nerators of Chern classes of the cohomology ring of the Hopf bundle as a coeﬃcient “group”\nfor representing the graph cobordism (quiver):\nh = (h/e)   e, h = h/m   m.\nOne may expect a natural duality between the two deformation parameters:\nhc = αe\n2, α =\nh/e\ne/c\n=\nqM\nqE\n,\nas for the duality between the quantum group of observables F(G) a la Woronovich (say\nG is the Lorentz group) and the quantum group (via bialgebra deformation quantization)\ncorresponding to the universal enveloping algebra of its Lie algebra:\nF(G)c < − > Uh(g).\nThis is conceivable in view of the invariants of the Hodge constitutive map χ.\nNote also that quantum Hall eﬀect introduces another “relation”, quantization of h/e2:\nσHall =\nh/e\ne\n, σc = 1/α.\nNow recall that on the “external side” of mass-space-time we have:\nGm\n2\np/hc = β ≈ 10\n−38,\nand maybe:\nlnG ∼ −1/α,\na “puzzle” worth staring at for a while.QUANTUM RELATIVITY 15\n6.3. The amazing duality. The micro and macro-cosmos correspondence via inversion\n(harmonic oscillator / Kepler problem [1]) is reminiscent of T-duality from the String Theory\n[43]. This is related with the Bohr’s planetary model for the H-atom, which is essentially the\nharmonic oscillator. Now the relation between Bohr’s radius (Compton wave length) and\nSchwartzschild radius for H-atom (qubit) is:\nr\np\nS/r\np\nB =\nGmp/c2\nh/mpc\n= Gm\n2\np/hc = β.\nCan we relate it with the constitutive relation χ? let’s try ...\n6.4. Hodge invariants and gravitational constant. Recall P = mv+qA or in cgs-units\nmv + q/cA. If switching to the bilocal model: P = m1v1 +  /rq1q2v2. With “better” units\n[37] and considering unit charges:\nP1 = m1v1 +\n \nǫ\ne\n2v2/r.\nNow in the bilocal physics angular velocity and angular momentum form a GCS g⊕g∗, while\nlinear momentum should be translated (compactiﬁed via projective spaces) into angular\nmomentum (“Descartes motto”), providing additional insight into the distinction between\nmass and electric charge.\nNow assume distance being quantized as a multiple of the Bohr radius, with r/rB = n\nprincipal orbital number. Assuming the non-relativistic Bohr model of H-atom (e.g. [36],\np.156):\nEn = 1/2mec\n2 α\n2/n\n2,\nthe above coupling coeﬃcient  /ǫ/r becomes (with m = me):\nZHall\ne2\nrB\nEn\nαmc2 = ZHall\nEn\nE∞\n,\nwhere the rest energy was denoted by E∞.\nFrom the above relation may speculate that there could be a relation between K± and ǫ\nand   of the form\nK− = −\n√\nǫ, K+ = 1/\n√\n \nyielding a possible meaning to the other invariant of χ:\n√\nG = δ = K+ + K− =\n1\n3\nTr(χ).\nThe main idea is that, in view of the interpretation of the EM vector potential, mass and\nelectric charge are directly related, and therefore so are kC and GN, Coulomb and Newton’s\nconstants.\n6.5. H-atom, protons and electrons. The relation between EM and Gravity, should\nbe a consequence of the relation between mass and electric charge. Their fundamental\nrepresentatives are the proton and electron, viewed as “free” particles, and the neutral H-\natom.16 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\nOur model is based on the qubit as the fundamental unit (QI, spinor, harmonic oscillator,\nlocal Minkovski space). We interpret it as representing the neutral H-atom, with its electron\nand proton as the Hopf (monopole) ﬁbration:\nSU1 ∼ = S\n1 → SU2 ∼ = S\n3 → S\n2.\nThe “free” instances of the electron and proton are represented by sections, or equivalently\nby the direct product SU1⊕SU2 ∼ = S1×S2. Breaking the symmetry could be an alternative\nmechanism for obtaining gravity.\nIn other words, when viewing an interaction as a link or degree of a bundle morphism, as\nwith the “Neumann” interpretation of the Biot-Savart law (see also [39]), then the interaction\npairings between H-atom S3, proton S2 and electron S1 could yield the diﬀerent coupling\ncoeﬃcients (matrix), which in turn would reﬂect into the simpliﬁed version K+  = −K−.\nNote that our interpretation of mass and charge amounts to taking the even and odd part\nof a signed scalar quantity (or relative to some other involution), maybe better with some\nweights:\nm = m+mp + m−me,q = m+ep − m−ee.\nThe current accepted values include mp/me ≈ 1836, based on the assumption ep = ee within\nmost of the theoretical frameworks (e.g. Bohr’s atom or QFT).\nCompare with the relativistic mass in terms of rapidity θ:\nm = m0 coshθ, tanhθ = β = v/c,\nand ponder whether its counterpart, the electric charge should vary as the odd part [14]:\nq = esinhθ,\ntowards a generalized rotation of Lorentz/symplectic type.\n7. Velocity as a Gauge Field\nThere is enough evidence to interpret velocity as a gauge ﬁeld, by exploiting the relation\nwith the EM vector potential, especially in the context of a background independent theory\n(BIT).\nRecall that the EM-vector potential is thought of as a transfer velocity. It should be (now)\nthought of as a transfered relative velocity, to gauge away an irrelevant uniform motion (BIT):\nA ∼ v2 − v1,\nwith vi values of the velocity gauge ﬁeld at particle 1 and 2 respectively.\nIn other words, abandon the coordinate point of view, as unavoidable in a BIT, and refer\nto distances as a “potential” via path integration, possibly multi-valued etc.\nThe curvature of velocity, or rather momentum and energy, should be interpreted as\nacceleration/force related; this at the inﬁnitesimal level. When exponentiated, the resulting\nmonodromy should be the SL2(C)-matrix associated to an exact cycle representing a matter\nsource and acceleration. It should thought of as the the vorticity of the QI-ﬂow through that\ncycle:\nΩ(cycle) =\nZ\nmv + eA < − > sl2(C), Ψ = U/B(cycle) = exp(iΩ/~).QUANTUM RELATIVITY 17\nHere mv + eA should be replaced by the 4-D relativistic version, corresponding to sl2(C) =\nsu2 ⊕sl2(R) under the Klein correspondence (QC∼ = SR), with the two components: unitary\n“space-like” quantum process and SL2(R)-Lorentz boost (GR: acceleration=gravity?).\nAgain we advocate that chirality of Hopf bundle would imply a Birkhoﬀ decomposition of\nthe spinor, with the corresponding decomposition of curvature/forces via logarithm, possible\nrelated to gravity (splitting the Hopf ﬁbration):\nΨ = Ψ+Ψ\n−1\n− , Ω = ΩEM − ΩG,\nyielding the “eﬀective” coupling constants K± (or the matrix).\n8. Deforming or Quantizing Special Relativity?\nTo “deform” Lorentz symmetries, we have the following alternative. The “winner” will be\nthe one yielding a gravitational term when deforming Lorentz force (if any).\n8.1. Deforming quaternions as a Lie algebra: (1+3)c. Quaternions Q, from the “1+3”\nSR side, is a central extension of the angular velocity Lie algebra ([,] the cross-product):\nR → Q → (R\n3,×), = t + (xLx + yLy + zLz)/c, (Lx = i,Lj = j,Lz = k),\nwith the “speed of light” c as a central element.\nViewed as a Lie algebra, it can be canonically deformed via the exponential/logarithm\n“non-linear” transformations, using BCH-formula. Since we think of 1/c as a deformation\nparameter dual to Plank’s constant h, we will denote it with h = 1/c (not to be confused\nwith h/2π). In dimensionless formulas t is a number and |v|/c is usually denoted with β:\nvh = v/c,q = (t,v) = t + vh.\nWith these notations BCH-formula is:\nq ⊕ q\n′ = q + q\n′ + 1/2[q,q\n′]h + 1/6([q,[q,q\n′]] − [q\n′,[q\n′,q]]) + ....\nThe induced deformed velocity addition should be compared with Einstein’s velocity addition\nlaw,which for parallel velocities is:\nv ⊕E v\n′ = (v + v\n′)/(1 + vv\n′h\n2\n) = (v + v\n′)(1 − vv\n′h\n2\n+ (vv\n′)\n2h\n4\n− ...)\n= v + v\n′ − {v(vv\n′) + v\n′(v\n′v)}h\n2\n+ ...\nRecall that a × (b × c) = (ac)b − (ab)c.\nThis time the deformed addition is associative for arbitrary velocities, unlike Einstein’s\naddition, and yielding a “Thomas rotation” time-like term.\n8.2. Quantizing quaternions: (2 + 2)h. Since gravity is not velocity dependent, let’s try\nquantizing the quaternion algebra, viewed from the “harmonic oscillator” side:\nQ = (T\n∗C,ω).\nFollowing the standard procedure for quantizing Heisenberg algebra as a central extension\nof the symplectic space:\nR → H → (T\n∗,ω),18 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\nconsider the analog central extension (inﬁnitesimal deformation):\nR → Q[h] → Q, q = z0|0 > +z1|1 >, [[0 >,|1 >] = ih.\ntogether with the corresponding deformation via BCH-formula (the UEA(Lie algebra) side):\nOn the other hand we have a Moyal product or Weyl quantization on its algebra of\nobservables (the F(G)h side).\nThe resulting Lie algebra/group with one more deformation parameter should be related\nwith the (anti) de Sitter groups [5].\nNow the question is weather the correspondence QC ∼ = SR : 2 + 2 = 1 + 3 is compatible\nwith the duality F(G)∗\nh ∼ = U(g)h.\n8.3. Deforming the Lorentz force ... again. In the context of Newton’s law, the Lorentz\nforce F = q(E + v × B) can be interpreted as coming from a potential, via the canonical\n(“electro-mechanic”) momentum:\nP = mv + qA,V = q(cφE/c − vA),d/dtP = −∇V.\nWith electric potential ΦE = 1/ǫ q2/|r| in place and transfer angular velocity A =  /r q2v2×\ner for the EM vector potential, it becomes:\nP12 = m1v1 +   q1q2 ω2 × er, V = q1q2/|r| [\n1\nǫ\n−   det(r,v2,v1)],\nwhere the determinant comes from the mixed product v1   (r × v2).\nThe separation of “space-time” components into momentum and energy, is performed at\nthe Lie algebra level, neglecting the non-linearity via exponential. Will this provide the\n“missing” gravitational term m1m2GN/|r|?\nIn fact a relativistic “potential” energy formula should involve a relativistic canonical\nmomentum:\nP\nrel = γm0(c,v) + q(ΦE/c,A),\nV\nrel = P\n2/m0 = c\n2 + q(ΦE − vA) + q\n2/m0((Φ/c)\n2 − A\n2).\nThe 1st term is a constant (discard), the 2nd is the “old” potential, while the 3rd appears\nas a “correction” term. In fact, in terms of the deformation parameter h = 1/c:\n(P/h)\n2/m0 = 1 + (qh)(ΦE − vA) + (qh)\n2((ΦE/c)\n2 − A\n2)/m0,\nis an invitation to a deformation series.\n8.4. ... or grading it with external symmetry groups? On the other hand a gravita-\ntional potential seems to come naturally together with the diﬀerent symmetry groups of the\nvarious types of interacting particles”: the “bound” H-atom (neutral qubit) corresponding\nto S3, and “free” protons and electrons (split qubit) with coupling constants corresponding\nto S2 and S1.\nThe simpliﬁed version was discussed in terms of the eﬀective coupling constants K± (elec-\ntric charges slightly not equal, or a parity issue due to the Hopf bundle).\nThe electric and magnetic interaction “force” would be expressible in terms of “Neumann\npotentials” [8] given by linking numbers (see also [40, 2, 11, 39]).QUANTUM RELATIVITY 19\nThe electric force can be represented using a (Gaussian) linking integral\nΦE =\ne1e2\nǫ\nZ\nS1\nZ\nS1\ndq   dq2\n|r|\n,\nbetween two “time-like” circle ﬁbers over the space-like charges (Hopf bundle), while the\n“magnetic force” (with   coupling constant in place of 1/ǫ), would result from linking two\n“space-time” circles as “moving charges”.\nAs an interesting possibility, the higher dimensional topological degrees for linking S2 and\nS3 could be related with weak and cromodynamics interactions.\nNow if the quaternionic product is deformed as above, there would be corresponding\ncorrection terms in the linking integrals.\nOn the other hand, the author inclines to believe that the gravitational and electric forces\nappear to be unrelated due to splitting the S3-Hopf bundle. At this stage one has to inves-\ntigate pairs of interacting particles modeled not just as pairs of qubits, but possibly as the\nHopf instanton bundle:\nS3\n￿￿\nQ−Gate // S3\n￿￿\nInternal Space : S3 → S7\n￿￿\nS2Distance // S2 External Space : S4.\nThe left side corresponds to the discrete picture of QID (quantum networks), while the right\nside corresponds to a continuum picture with base a compactiﬁed Minkovski space-time and\nﬁber gauge group SU2.\n9. Conclusions\nStarting from the general framework of QID as a natural framework for a Background\nSpace-Time Independent Theory, the article presents some alternatives to be investigated\nstarting from the idea that the “unifying gauge group” is in fact the Hopf monopole bundle,\nunderlying quaternion algebra (spinors). Its roles within the physics interface are:\n1) Unit of quantum information (Quantum Computing side: 2 + 2),\n2) Harmonic oscillator (Quantum Mechanics side: 2 + 2∗),\n3) Minkovski local space-time (1 + 3).\nLorentz symmetries and Minkowski space seem to describe the inﬁnitesimal/linear pic-\nture. Their deformation into the non-linear/non-commutative realm represents an avenue\nfor obtaining gravitational potential as an exponential correction of the electric force, which\ntogether with the magnetic (and possibly weak and strong) appear as given by linking inte-\ngrals (topological degrees).\nTogether with the dynamics of the quantum networks, as a cohomology theory of dg-\ncoalgebra of graphs, QID seems to provide the general mathematical framework and concep-\ntual interface one would expect from a “Theory of Everything”.\n10.

Annex: Quantum Gravity - An Open project\nKnowledge accumulates exponentially, and so do physics theories grow in complexity. This\nleads to a cumulative development, e.g. the Standard Model as an Expert System in particle\nphysics, similar to the rise of Windows through upgrades and patches.\nSome say Physics is in “trouble” [42], and Mathematics has nothing to do with it [52];\nothers are less gentle about the lack of a breakthrough in physics as of the “dark ages of\nphysics” [34].\nThe author believes that a change in the current R&D methodology can trigger a change\nof paradigm: open math-physics “programming using a web platform such as nLab [35]; a\nnew physics model could be designed top-down, as an Expert System, taking advantage of\nthe existing math-physics “toolkits”, yielding a better and “cleaner” alternative to the SM,\nsimilar to Linus as alternative Operating System alternative to Windows.\nin this article the author sketches a more speciﬁc plan of attaking the problem of Quantum\nGravity, based on the previous sketches [19], as a follow up of the general principles and\nincorporated resources from [16].\nThe aim is to formulate a viable Project to be developed according to the above suggested\nmethodology.\nMore speciﬁcally, a project for implementing Quantum Gravity as a deformation of infor-\nmation dynamics, as an SU2 “upgrade” of Electromagnetism, to account for the charge-parity\nviolation, is sketched.\nIt is based on the framework of Quantum Relativity, and the associated math-physics\ntool-box. The unifying “gauge group” being the Hopf bundle, underlying the quaternion\nalgebra as a generalized complex structure. Its quantum group deformation yields Gravity.\nThe discrete formulation renders the resulting theory already quantum, with a particle-wave\ncohomological duality.\nThe new paradigm of Quantum Information Dynamics is prone for plugging in the main\nideas of the Standard Model regarding the weak and strong interactions.\n11.1. The Main Ideas. Gravity is implemented as a deformation of an “Electromag-\nnetism”, in the framework of Quantum Information Dynamics [19, 18].\nThe framework is that of a category with duality; for example SL2(C)-graph cobordisms,\nrepresenting quantum processes.\nThe mathematical theory is of the type “loop groupoid representations”; it is a Yang-Mills\ngauge theory bypassing connections by using Wilson observables directly, corresponding to\nthe connection’s monodromy.\nIn addition to SL2(C)-gravity, we deform the “gauge group” SL2(C) which here is treated\nas a bundle enlarging SU2 viewed as the Hopf monopole bundle. The deformation parameter\nof the resulting quantum group SL2(C)h [45] is the reciprocal of the “speed” of light h = 1/c\n[18].QUANTUM RELATIVITY 21\nWe develop the mathematical connection between the Hopf algebra structure of SL2(C)\nand Hodge structure on the generalized complex structure [12] of the deformed quaternions\nQh, containing SL2(C)h, interpreting it from a physical point of view as a deformation of\nthe “metric” coeﬃcients representing the “curvature” due to matter. The quantum net is\nthought oﬀ as a special material with electric and magnetic permittivity\nχ = (ǫ,1/ ) : λ\n2 → Λ\n2 ↔ ds\n2 = ǫ dr\n2 − 1/  dt\n2,\nby using an extended version of the Klein correspondence [15] between Minkowski space: the\nQuantum Computing [51] - Special Relativity correspondence QC ∼ = SR : 2 + 2∗ = 1 + 3.\nThe constitutive isomorphism [37] is an r-matrix entering the deformation of the Hodge\nduality structure, and yielding the bialgebra deformation “quantization”, or alternatively,\nthe generalized complex structure deformation (Hodge deformation).\nRecall that under the 2+2∗ = 1+3 above correspondence, the determinant (Kahler form)\nis mapped onto the Lorentz metric:\nu = (x,y,z,ct) ∈ (M\n3,1,ds\n2) ↔ H ∋ ξ =\n￿\na = z − ct b = x − iy\nc = x + iy d = z + ct\n￿\n⇒ ||u|| = ǫ dr\n2 − 1/  dt\n2 = det(ξ) = aa\n∗ − bb\n∗.\nHere we take advantage of the grading introduced on the central extension of the angular\nvelocity Lie algebra ([,] the cross-product):\nR → Q → (R\n3,×), = t + (xLx + yLy + zLz)/c, (Lx = i,Lj = j,Lz = k), (2)\nwith the “speed of light” c as a central element; the involution is a Z2-graded complex\nconjugation:\n∗(z + ct) = z − ct, ∗(x + iy) = x − iy.\n11.2. Charge-conjugation violation. The classical two charges ± are the eigenvalues of\nthe involution ∗. The quantum deformation yields a twist ∗2 = δ [6], responsible for breaking\nthe symmetry. In this way we implement the idea that Gravity is due to a charge-conjugation\nviolation, which produces an additional term in Newton’s law with Coulomb’s potential for\nelectric force (static case).\nin a Lagrangian formulation, with the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation, the de-\nformed symmetries yield via Noether Theorem a quantum charge which does not obey the\nstandard Fermi statistics, due to a deformed braiding\nσ = R ◦ Twist, R = Rota − Baxter operator;\nfor details on the relation between r-matrix, bialgebra deformation (Poisson-Lie groups,\nleft/right dressing action etc.), Yang-baxter equation, braiding etc. see [6].\nDeforming SL2(C), or rather Cliﬀord algebra of quaternions, yields the quantum deter-\nminant which is interpreted in [18] as the Newton-Coulomb coupling constant:\nQdet\n￿\nq im′\n−im q′\n￿\n= qq\n′ − e\n−1/α mm\n′. (3)22 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\n11.3. The Category with Duality and CPT. The category with duality corresponding\nto the quantum group implements mathematically the Charge-Parity-Time Theorem, as\nmentioned in [24].\nThe twist / braiding which breaks the charge-conjugation symmetry also corresponds to\nthe chirality of the “gauge group”, i.e. the chirality of the Hopf monopole bundle. In\na precise sense QID posseses not only electric and information charges (qubits), but also\nmagnetic charges as degrees of the hopf bundles “sitting” over the nodes of the Q-net.\nThe interaction picture model consists of a pair of quabits mapped to the Hopf instanton\nbundle S3 → S7 → S4, again a “topological fragment” of the algebraic double SU(2,2).\n11.4. Dirac’s equation. In the categorical framework, the splitting of the Dirac spinor into\nthe chiral Weyl spinors obeing Dirac’s equation [44] is essentially a Birkhoﬀ decomposition\nof the representation:\nΨ = Φ\n+/Φ\n−, D = d + d\n∗\nfor details see [9] and related articles.\nSo the deformation of SL2(C) induces a parity violation also (see Hermitian categories\n[4]), which allows to account for neutrinos as twist, and the lack of left-handed ones.\nThe quarks and quark charges appear from the interplay between SU2 and SO(3,C),\nwith the corresponding Hopf degrees (monopole and instanton bundles: see the link number\ninteraction model).\n11.5. The Fundamental Constants. The two approximate eigenvalues e± ≈ ± of ∗, i.e.\nthe two charges will obey a constraint coming from the central extension of the angular\nvelocity Lie algebra:\nhc = e\n+e\n−.\nhere h is Plank’s constant, the trademark of the angular velocity Lie algebra g = (R3,×),\nc = 1/h is the “speed” of light related to the deformation parameter (central element) h.\nThe constraint satisﬁed by the deformed involution/antipode of the quantum group is:\nc\n2 =\n1\nǫ \n, h\n2\n= ǫ/(1/ ).\nThe other “quantizations” of magnetic ﬂux, hall conductivity are related to the invariants\nof the deformed Hodge structure χ:\nQuantum flux : gM = hc/e, Quantum Charges : e\n+ = e − δ,e\n− = −e − δ,\nHall conductivity =\nǫ\n \n= det(χ)\n1/3.\nRecall that δ yields the Newton’s gravity term as a correction to Coulomb’s law (3).\nThe ﬁne structure constant appears as an asymptotic ratio, with the classical approxima-\ntion for charges gE = e being used:\nα = e\n2/hc = gE/gM;\nfor details regarding the interplay of ǫ, ,χ,c see [38].\nReturning to Dirac equation, as Dirac stated [25], p.3, electric charge should be derived\nfrom h as a square root; that is what we claim above. Splitting the extension yields a doubleQUANTUM RELATIVITY 23\ncover and e = ±\n√\nhc; in the deformed case, the chirality should be included. The corre-\nsponding covering map should be responsible for the “average” yielding the ﬁne structure\nconstant, essentially a zeta value [24] combined with a Casimir element/ central charge\nα = e\n2/hc ↔ “137\n′′ h = Det(Q) h, Det(Q) = e\n+e\n−. (4)\nNow on the “mass” side of the canonic momentum P = mv + qA, which is implemented\nin the context of the generalized complex structure TC ⊕T ∗C on SL2(C)h, the deformation\nof charges yields a gravitational constant\nGN = e\n−β,β ↔ 1/α.\nThe relation should bypass α, being expressed in terms of h,c,e±.\nIt seems that the charge defect δ [18] is related to the other invariant of the deformation\n∗:\nGN = δ\n2 ↔ Tr(χ) = ǫ − 1/ , GN/kC = e\n−β.\nThe numeric factors were discarded for emphasis of the conceptual meaning, in the sense of\ndimensional analysis.\n11.6. Harmonic analysis on groupoids. So a quantum process is modeled as a represen-\ntation of a quantum network, with coeﬃcients in a Hopf algebra (quantum group SL2(C)h).\nNow in analogy with Fourier analysis, the spectra of graph cobordisms [3, 17] should yield\nthe “vibration modes” of the Q-net. From the Riemann surfaces side of the picture via\nribbon graphs and Turaev-Feynman calculus [46], the modes should correspond to integral\nperiods of the Hodge structure.\nFrom the physical point of view, the “frequencies” are due to a resonance condition:\nω\n2 = 1/LC ↔ c\n2 = 1/ǫ .\nin a direct analogy with electric circuits as SU1-voltage graphs (circle bundles over chain\ncomplexes, Pontryagin duality etc.), inductance corresponds to mass, and “elasticity” of the\nharmonic oscillator corresponds to capacitance (parameter of the qubit or quantum register\nviewed as a harmonic oscillator [18]).\n11.7. Relation to the Standard Model. The relation between the “gauge group of the\nSM SU1 × SU2 × SU3 and the Hopf bundles, monopole and instanton, underlying the main\nobject, the symplectic qubit X = T ∗H (reality is One dimensional internally, and potentially\ninﬁnite dimensional externally), and its processes G = Aut(T ∗H), makes the transfer of\n“technology” to the new paradigm of QID/QG possible.\nAs a previous attempt to implement quarks and mesons using links, we mention [26]. This\nattempt was done in the spirit of String Theory, embedding circles in a conﬁguration man-\nifold, without being relativistic. These two important “lessons” can be used to implement\nthe quark model and strong interaction in QID, using linking numbers [18] (homological al-\ngebra invariants and derived functors; dg-coalgebras of graph cobordisms and its equivariant\ncohomology with coeﬃcients in SL2(C)h [20]).24 LUCIAN M. IONESCU\n11.8. Further Developments. The Quantum Computing model of Special Relativity, once\ndeformed, seems to be the ideal ground for developing Quantum Gravity as a Grand Uniﬁed\nTheory (Theory of Everything).\nThe Hodge periods/Quantum Groups approach is prone for an abstract formulation in\nterms of hermitian categories; a Tanaka-Krein duality should be related with the Connes-\nKreimer Hopf algebra approach to renormalization [7], where Rota-Baxter Algebra with\nRB-operator R is a diﬀerent face of an r-matrix and dd∗-structure leading to deformation\n[22, 23].\nA web-based platform such as John Baez’s nLab [35] seems to be ideal for the development\nof this project.\nReferences\n[1] Arnold, V.I., Kozlov, V.V., Neishtadt, A.I., Iacob, A., Mathematical Aspects of Classical and Celestial\nMechanics, Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences, 3rd ed., 2006.\n[2] Barrett, T., Topological foundations of EM, World Scientiﬁc Series in Contemporary Chemical Physics,\nVol. 26, 2008.\n[3] Biggs, N., Algebraic Graph Theory, Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 1993.\n[4] Bakalov, B., and Kirillov, A.

INTRODUCTION\nIt is a great honor for me to be speaking at this sympo-\nsium for Prof. C. N. Yang. Like many other physicists,\nI have always envied Prof. Yang’s many excellent contri-\nbutions to science over the years, and have even shared\nthe common experience of aspiring to match them and\nmanaging to fall short. Dealing with this is not a happy\nthing. I confess having become depressed over it for a\ntime and cheering up only after realizing that everyone\nelse had the same problem. I now no longer worry about\nit. One should no more agonize over this inadequacy than\nover being too short or bald. I recommend this course of\naction for the rest of you suﬀerers, incidentally, in case\nyou have not ﬁgured it out already for yourselves. I also\nrecommend that we keep trying, for Prof. Yang continues\nto be the man to beat.\nMy views on the great unsolved questions at the core of\nmodern physics—quantum measurement, the emergence\nof the correspondence limit through decoherence, spon-\ntaneous ordering, hierarchies of laws—are strongly in-\nﬂuenced by my life in condensed matter physics, where\ntheoretical ideas are forced to immediate and brutal con-\nfrontation with experiment by virtue of the latter’s low\ncost. Anyone subjected to this long enough eventually\ndevelops the habit of thinking experimentally, of choos-\ning experimental issues primarily on the basis of what\none could measure in a given situation, and evaluating\ntheories mainly on the basis of the experiments they cor-\nrectly predict. This is considered overly conservative in\nmany circles, but I disagree. I believe that physics is an\nexperimental science, and that theory acquires author-\nity by confronting and conforming to experiment, not\nthe other way around. Dealing with a rich experimental\nrecord day after day has the additional beneﬁt of giving\none a healthy respect for the natural world’s ability to\nsurprise and a healthy disrespect for the belief that all\nthings can be calculated from ﬁrst principles.\n?\n?\nFIG. 1: Einstein gravity is similar to a heavy ball placed on\na rubber membrane, except that the membrane ruptures if\nthe ball is too heavy. Rupturing can be prevented by declar-\ning the laws of elasticity to be true no matter how extreme\nthe stretching, but this is unphysical. The solution to the\nblack hole problem may be that the relativity principle, like\nelasticity, is emergent and simply fails at the event horizon.\nII. THE RELATIVITY PRINCIPLE\nI wish today to discuss the black hole horizon paradox\nand the incompatibility of relativity and quantum me-\nchanics. This is obviously a great problem in the physics\npantheon and something of great interest to all of us,\nparticularly in light of recent advances in string theory.\nHowever, what I have to say is not so friendly to micro-\nscopic approaches of this kind. I have become increas-\ningly concerned that the essence of the problem may not\nbe microscopic at all but collective, and that studying mi-\ncroscopic models of the vacuum may be the wrong thing\nto do even if the models are right. I think black hole\nformation may be a quantum phase transition1,2.\nBefore explaining how such a thing could be consistent\nwith Einstein gravity and working out the experimen-\ntal consequences, let me explain the basic idea, which\nis straightforward. Let us imagine a stretched rubber\nsheet with a heavy ball rolling on it, as shown in Fig.\n1. This is the stripped-down model of gravity familiar\nfrom science museum exhibits. The membrane repre-\nsents space-time, the ball represents some gravitating ob-\nject, the distortion represents the gravitational ﬁeld, and2\nthe motions of small objects on the membrane represent\ngeodesic trajectories of satellites. If the ball is not too\nheavy then the membrane distorts elastically to make a\nslight depression in response to its weight. Small objects\nin the vicinity then fall into this distortion and orbit,\nmembrane vibrations beamed at the ball scatter, and so\nforth in analogy with general relativity. If the ball is too\nheavy, on the other hand, the membrane ruptures and\nthe ball falls through. When this happens the analogy\nwith Einstein gravity fails completely, since the relativity\nprinciple requires every point in space-time to be locally\nindistinguishable from any other, and thus expressly for-\nbids rupture. The formal statement of this problem is\nthat the black hole event horizon, the obvious candidate\nfor catastrophic failure in general relativity, exhibits no\nsingular behavior in any quantity measured in local coor-\ndinates. However, catastrophic failure is precisely what\nI suspect is happening at real black hole surfaces.\nWhat would facilitate this breakdown and at the same\ntime reconcile it with what we know experimentally\nabout relativity are the limit paradoxes of continuous\nquantum phase transitions3,4. Known physical principles\noperating at such transitions would enable relativity to\nfail quantum mechanically, just as laws of elasticity fail\nin the membrane, but so gently that classical Einstein\ngravity would not be violated in any region of space-time\nexperimentally accessible to us1. This latter point is not\nobvious, especially if one has not thought carefully about\nphases and phase transitions, so one of my main tasks\nhere today is to explain it convincingly.\nThe possibility of relativity failure is diﬃcult for most\nof us to think about, but should not be. When asked\nwhether relatively applies at the Planck scale, for exam-\nple, most physicists will attempt to change the subject\nand, in the end, avoid committing one way or the other\neven though traditional relativity forbids preferred scales.\nEverybody understands that relativity is believable be-\ncause it is measured to be true, not because it ought to\nbe true, and that extrapolating many orders of magni-\ntude beyond present measurement capability is no less\ndangerous in relativity than it is in anything else.\nIII. CRITICAL OPALESCENCE\nLet me now begin by reminding you about the simplest\nknown example of a phase transition, ordinary vaporiza-\ntion. In 1910 Johannes van der Waals won the Nobel\nPrize in physics for his work on non-ideal gasses, and\nparticularly for his invention of the relation\n(p +\na\nv2)(v − b) = kBT , (1)\nknown today as the van der Waals equation of state5.\nThis approximate description of the non-deal gas cap-\ntures the essential features of both departures from ide-\nality in real vapors and the liquid-vapor transition they\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \np\n \np\nc\nv\n \nv\nc\nN\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\nC\nr\ni\nt\ni\nc\na\nl\nP\no\ni\nn\nt\nFIG. 2: Pressure versus volume per atom given by Eq. (1) for\nvarious temperatures. The critical volume, pressure and tem-\nperature are vc = 3b, pc = a/27b\n2, and kBTc = 8a/27b. The\nincrement between successive isotherms is ∆T = 0.05Tc. The\ndotted lines show the equation of state before the Maxwell\nconstruction. For freon (CCl2F2) the critical temperature is\n385\n◦K and the critical pressure 4.12 MPa (37 atmospheres).\nanticipate. p is the pressure, v is the volume per molecule,\nT is the temperature, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and\na and b are parameters characterizing the non-ideality of\nthe ﬂuid. a represents the eﬀects of attractive bonding\nforces between the molecules, and b represents the volume\nexcluded due to short-range molecular repulsions. Both\nparameters are empirically adjusted to ﬁt the properties\nof a speciﬁc substance. Setting them to zero produces\nthe ideal gas law.\nThe van der Waals equation of state describes the\nphase transition only implicitly. It may be seen in Fig.\n2 that its isotherms exhibit unphysical inﬂections at low\ntemperatures that result in the bulk modulus\nk = −v\n∂p\n∂v\n(2)\nbecoming negative. This is a symptom of the theory’s\nfailure to correctly describe liquid-vapor coexistence.\nFrom the vast amount of work done on this problem in\nthe 1970s, culminating in the invention of the Wilson\nrenormalization group6, we understand that equations of\nstate near phase transitions are inherently nonanalytic,\nand that analytic ﬁts to them generally produce non-\nsense when extrapolated across phase boundaries. These\nnon-analyticities are, however, eﬀects of large size and\ndisappear when the sample is small. Taken literally, the\nVan der Waals equation of state is a description of a small\nsample. To apply it to a large sample we must take into\naccount for the system’s tendency to separate into regions\nof high and low density. This is accomplished by ﬁnding\na pressure at which the area under a straight line drawn\nbetween the two extremal volumes is the same as that\nunder the inﬂecting equation of state. The end points3\nof this Maxwell construction then deﬁne the liquid and\nvapor densities5.\nThe critical point - the top of the liquid-vapor dome\nwhere the two-phase region shrinks to zero - is especially\nimportant for our discussion of black holes. At this point,\nand this point only, the bulk modulus of the ﬂuid is iden-\ntically zero. For temperatures above the critical temper-\nature Tc, inﬂection does not occur, the liquid and va-\npor phases are physically indistinguishable, and the bulk\nmodulus is positive. For temperature less than Tc, phase\nseparation occurs, and the bulk modulus at either end of\nthe Maxwell construction is again positive. Thus at this\npoint, and this point only, the speed of sound\nc =\np\nk/ρ , (3)\nwhere M and ρ = M/v are the mass and mass density of\nthe molecules, vanishes.\nIn conventional ﬂuids, the vanishing of the sound speed\nat the critical point causes critical opalescence, a strange\nphenomenon in which the ﬂuid becomes cloudy and\nopaque to the transmission of light, like an opal. This\nis very dramatic to see. My colleague Doug Osheroﬀ\nhere at Stanford has a freshman physics demonstration of\ncritical opalescence that uses freon as the working ﬂuid.\nThe critical pressure and temperature of freon are suf-\nﬁciently low that one can do this without endangering\nstudents in the front row. Doug sets the temperature to\nthe critical value and then slowly ramps up the pressure,\nwhile Richard Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra plays in\nthe background. If he times it right, the laser shining\nthrough the freon winks out at the exact moment the or-\nchestra plays “Ta Daa,” and gets him a standing ovation.\nCritical opalescence signals a fundamental failure of\nhydrodynamics4. Equipartition among the degrees of\nfreedom of compressional sound, which exist by virtue of\nthe principles of hydrodynamics, requires the departure\nof the particle density from its average value to obey\n<δρ(r)δρ(r′)>=\nkBT ρ2\n(2π)3k\nZ\n|q|<1/ξ\neiq (r−r\n′) dq , (4)\nwhere r and r′ denote diﬀerent positions in the ﬂuid, 1/ξ\nis an ultraviolet cutoﬀ (i.e. a scale at which hydrody-\nnamics fails), and <> denotes thermal average. This is\nthe quantity measured in a light scattering experiment.\nIt becomes enormous at the critical point because k goes\nto zero. However, since the density correlator cannot ac-\ntually become inﬁnite, we know that the key premise of\nthe calculation, the validity of hydrodynamics, must fail.\nThis occurs in practice through the divergence of ξ at the\ncritical point.\nThe laws of hydrodynamics are emergent. They are\nuniversal, exact mathematical relationships among mea-\nsured quantities that develop at long length scales in liq-\nuids and gases. This development cannot be deduced\nfrom the underlying equations of motion of the atoms.\n \n \n￿\n5\n \n \n￿\n4\n \n \n￿\n3\n \n \n￿\n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC\n \nL\n3\n￿\nT\n \n￿\nK\n \nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nFIG. 3: Speciﬁc heat of Al2O3 in units of calories/gm\n◦K ver-\nsus temperature as measured\n7 (dots) and as given by Eq. (5)\nwith c = 6142 m/sec. The mass density, bulk modulus and\npoisson ratio of this material are ρ = 3.89 gm/cm\n3, k = 228\nGPa, and σ = 0.22, respectively. The transverse and longitu-\ndinal sound speeds computed from these are then ct = 6355\nm/sec and cℓ = 10602 m/sec. Their appropriately weighted\naverage is 2c\n−3 = 2c\n−3\nt + c\n−3\nℓ .\nIt is a physical phenomenon - one we know to be ex-\nactly true because it is measured to be true. Emergent\nlaws are equivalent to, and indistinguishable from, fun-\ndamental laws in all ways but one: they are vulnerable\nto failure by simply not emerging. This is what happens\nat the critical point.\nIV. QUANTUM PHASES\nPhases and phase transitions are not inherently ﬁnite-\ntemperature phenomena. They occur at zero tempera-\nture as well, and are regulated by principles of emergence\nin the same way as their ﬁnite-temperature relatives. The\nimportant diﬀerence is that zero-temperature phases are\npurely quantum-mechanical phenomena.\nA quantum phase familiar from everyday experience is\nthe crystalline solid. If this is an insulator its low-energy\nquantum excitations consist of center-of-massmotion and\nsound solely. Both are quantum-mechanical. The sound\nwaves of the cold solid are quantized “particles” with apt\nphysical similarities with particles of light. This analogy\nbecomes increasingly exact as the energy scale is low-\nered and, in the end, results in the low-temperature spe-\nciﬁc heat of all crystalline insulators becoming the Planck\nblackbody law\nC\nL3 =\n4π2\n15\n(\nkBT\n¯ hc\n)3 kB (5)\nwith the speed of light rescaled down to the speed of\nsound. This is shown for the speciﬁc case of Al2O3 in\nFig. 3.\nThe liquid and gas phases also exist at zero temper-\nature. The liquid is realized by either 4He nor 3He—4\nboth of which become superﬂuids when cooled to zero\ntemperature (although 3He is more complicated)8. The\ncompressional sound waves in these ﬂuids are quantum-\nmechanical particles that become more and more accu-\nrately deﬁned and relativistic as the energy scale is low-\nered. Their vapor pressures become unmeasurably small\nat low temperatures—meaning that both will puddle at\nthe bottom of a container and will not expand to ﬁll the\navailable volume. The vapor is realized by atomic bose-\neinstein condensates, the discovery of which by Cornell,\nKetterle, and Weiman was awarded the Nobel Prize in\nphysics in 20019,10. Atomic condensates are metastable\nstates of matter and thus not, strictly speaking, quantum\nphases. However, this is unimportant. They are ground\nstates of an equivalent ﬁctitious hamiltonian and have\nall the important physical properties of phases. Like 4He\nand 3He they exist as superﬂuids at ultralow tempera-\ntures and have nonzero bulk moduli12. Unlike helium,\nhowever, they do expand to ﬁll any available volume.\nThe existence of the quantum liquid and gas in na-\nture means that we can think about the phase transition\nbetween them, even though it has never been observed\nin the laboratory. The ideal behavior would be a phase\ndiagram something like Fig. 2 except with the “tem-\nperature” reinterpreted as parameter in the underlying\nequations of motion.\nUnfortunately, not every parameterization of this tran-\nsition produces a phase diagram like that of Fig. 2. Real\n4He is described by the equations\ni¯ h\n∂Ψ\n∂t\n= H Ψ (6)\nH = −\nN X\nj\n¯ h\n2\n2M\n∇2\nj + V (r1,...,rN) (7)\nV (r1,...,rN) =\nX\nj<k\nVpair(rj − rk) , (8)\nwhere Vpair is a pair potential, given reasonably accu-\nrately by\nVpair(r) = V0\n￿\n(\nr0\nr\n)12 − 2(\nr0\nr\n)6\n￿\n, (9)\nwith r0 = 3 ˚ A and V0 = 11 ◦K13. We know this to\nbe true because the pair potential has been accurately\nmeasured in atomic beam experiments (cf. Fig. 4).\nAlso, variational calculations using this potential predict\nthe correct ground state energy14, pair correlation func-\ntion, crystallization pressure and superﬂuid transition\ntemperature15. Since the cohesion of the liquid comes\nfrom the coeﬃcient of of 1/r6 in this potential, the most\nobvious way to produce the gas phase is to reduce this\n-\n0\n.\n5\n0\n0\n.\n5\n0\n.\n7\n5\n1\n1\n.\n2\n5\n1\n.\n5\n1\n.\n7\n5\n2\nV\n \nV\n0\nr\n \nr\n0\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nFIG. 4: Comparison of He-He pair potential measured by\natomic-beam scattering\n11 (dots) with the model of Eq.

SUPERFLUIDITY\nTo make a phase diagram like that of Fig. 2 we must\nadd multi-body interaction potentials17. The simplest\nway to accomplish this is to sum short-range components\ninto a density functional. Let us consider speciﬁcally\nV (r1,...,rN) = V1N + V2\nN X\nj<k\n(\nβr2\n0\nπ\n)\n3/2e\n−β|rj−rk|\n2\n+ ...\n+ Vn\nX\nj1<...<jn\nn−3/2\n￿\nnβr2\n0\nπ\n￿(3n−3)/2 Y\n <ν\ne−β|rjµ−rjν|\n2\n(10)\nwhere r0 is a characteristic length, in the limit β → ∞.\nThe multi-center functions in this expression are zero\nunless n particles are coincident in space, and are nor-\nmalized to yield 1 when integrated on all but one of\ntheir arguments. With this convention Eqs. (6) and (7)\nmay be re-expressed compactly as the classical lagrangian\ndensity18,19\nL = ψ∗(i¯ h\n∂\n∂t\n+  )ψ −\n¯ h\n2\n2M\n|∇ψ|2 − U(|ψ(r|2) , (11)\nwhere   is the chemical potential and\nU(|ψ|\n2) =\nV1\n1!\n|ψ|\n2 +\nV2\n2!\nr\n3\n0|ψ|\n4 +\nV3\n3!\nr\n6\n0|ψ|\n6 + ... . (12)\nThus Vjr\n3(j−1)\n0 are simply the Taylor expansion coeﬃ-\ncients of U.\nThe quantum equation of state implicit in models such\nas Eq. (11) are easy to work out when the potentials are\nweak20. The reason is that the ﬂuid bose condenses, the5\noperator ψ acquires a vacuum expectation value ψ →<\nψ >, and the entire problem becomes classical. As with\nany superﬂuid order parameter, the square ψ has the\nphysical meaning of a particle density: |ψ|2 = 1/v. The\nusual rules of canonical quantization then give us for the\nexpected energy\n<H>=\nZ ￿\n¯ h\n2\n2M\n|∇ψ|\n2 + U(|ψ|\n2) −  |ψ|\n2\n￿\ndr . (13)\nThis allows us to identify U(|ψ|2) as the energy per unit\nvolume of the ﬂuid as a function of its density, and\np = |ψ|2U′(|ψ|2) − U(|ψ|2) (14)\nas the pressure. The quantum ground state is implicitly\ndeﬁned by the energy-minimization condition\n  = U′(|ψ|2) . (15)\nIt is also easy to work out what U must be to give an\nequation of state like that of Fig. 2. We need to modify\nEq. (1) somewhat because the pressure of a quantum\nﬂuid is due to interactions and thus must fall oﬀ at least\nas fast as 1/v2 if the potentials are to be short-ranged.\nThus we take\n(p +\na\nv4)(v2 − b) = d , (16)\nwhere a, b, and d are hamiltonian parameters. Since\nZ\np dv =\nd\n2\n√\nb\nln(\nv −\n√\nb\nv +\n√\nb\n) +\na\n3v3 , (17)\nwe then have\nU(|ψ|\n2) = d −\nd\n2\n√\nb|ψ|2 ln(\n1 −\n√\nb|ψ|2\n1 +\n√\nb|ψ|2) −\na\n3\n|ψ|\n4\n= −\na\n3\n|ψ|4 + d\n￿\n(\n√\nb|ψ|2)2\n3\n+\n(\n√\nb|ψ|2)4\n5\n+ ...\n￿\n. (18)\nThe analysis of this equation of state, including the\nMaxwell construction, is exactly the same as with Eq.\n(1). It becomes critical when d = 8a/27b.\nThe dispersion relation of compressional sound implicit\nin such models has an important characteristic form. Be-\ncause it is classical, the motion is deﬁned by the extremal\ncondition δL/δψ∗ = 0, which is satisﬁed when\ni¯ h\n∂ψ\n∂t\n= −\n¯ h\n2\n2M\n∇2ψ +\n￿\nU′(|ψ|2) −  \n￿\nψ .

As its mo-\nmentum increases this excitation evolves adiabatically from a\nrelativistic sound quantum into a free boson.\nAssuming that ψ = ψ0+δψR+iδψI, where ψ0 is real and\nδψR and δψI are both small, we have, to linear order,\n¯ h\n∂(δψR)\nδt\n= −\n¯ h\n2\n2M\n∇\n2(δψI)\n−¯ h\n∂(δψI)\nδt\n= −\n¯ h\n2\n2M\n∇\n2(δψR)+2U\n′′(ψ\n2\n0)ψ\n2\n0 δψR .

(22)\nThis is plotted in Fig. 5.\nEq. (22) contains a length scale\nξ = ¯ h/Mc . (23)\ncentral to our discussion. The linear relation ω = cq ex-\npected of a compressional ﬂuid occurs only when qξ <<\n1. At scales longer than ξ, the principles of quantum hy-\ndrodynamics, the zero-temperature version of the famil-\niar laws of classical ﬂuids, become exact, and we obtain\na gas of noninteracting relativistic scalar bosons charac-\nterized by velocity c. At length scales shorter than ξ, on\nthe other hand, the principles of quantum hydrodynam-\nics fail, and these particles acquire a decay width and are\nnot guaranteed even to exist.6\nVI. QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT\nEq. (22) is extremely important for our argu-\nment, so let us derive it by a second method due to\nBogoliubov21,22. The reasoning in this case is more\nstraightforward but less general, in that it applies only\nto the weakly-interacting bose gas.\nThe starting point of the calculation is again conven-\ntional quantum mechanics as deﬁned by Eqs. (6) and\n(7), but we use only a pair sum, as in Eq. (8), with the\nshort-range repulsive potential\nVpair(r) = V2r\n3\n0 δ\n3(r) . (24)\nWith this done Eq. (7) may be rewritten\nH =\nX\nq\n¯ h\n2q2\n2M\na\n†\nqaq\n+\nV2r3\n0\n2L3\nX\nq\nX\nq′\nX\n∆q\na\n†\nq+∆qa\n†\nq′−∆qaq′aq , (25)\nwhere a†\nq and aq are bose creation and annihilation op-\nerators satisfying the usual commutation relations\n[aq,aq′] = 0 [aq,a\n†\nq′] = δqq′ . (26)\nWe assume for simplicity that the bosons live in a box of\nvolume L3 with periodic boundary conditions and that\nthe pair potential is weak.\nThe calculation is again simpliﬁed by the phenomenon\nof bose condensation. This causes the q = 0 state to\nacquire macroscopic occupancy N. When this number\nis thermodynamically large (but not otherwise) the q =\n0 state becomes a particle reservoir for the rest of the\nsystem. The most signiﬁcant eﬀect of the potential is\nto then to scatter particles out of, and back into, the\ncondensate in pairs. The matrix element for this process\nis always about NV2r3\n0/L3, since <a\n†\n0a0 >≃ N. Thus if\nwe ignore the depletion of N due to scattering of bosons\nout of the condensate then we may simply replace a0 and\na\n†\n0 everywhere they appear in Eq. (25) with\n√\nN. This\ngives\nHeﬀ =\nX\nq =0\n￿\n(\n¯ h\n2q2\n2M\n+\nNV2r3\n0\nL3 ) a†\nqaq\n+\nNV2r3\n0\n2L3 (a†\nqa\n†\n−q + a−qaq)\n￿\n+\nN2V2r3\n0\n2L3 . (27)\nHeﬀ does not conserve particle number, but this is simply\nan approximation. In reality any promotion of particles\nout of the condensate will be matched by a corresponding\nreduction of N.\nThis hamiltonian may be easily diagonialized by\ncanonical transformation. Let\nbq = uqaq + vqa\n†\n−q . (28)\nThen the condition\n[bq,bq′] = 0 [bq,b\n†\nq′] = δqq′ (29)\nrequires that u2\nq − v2\nq = 1, which is satisﬁed when\nuq = cosh(θq) vq = sinh(θq) . (30)\nThe inverse of Eq. (29) is aq = uqbq − vqb\n†\n−q. Substi-\ntuting this into Eq. (27) we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcients of\nb†\nqb\n†\n−q and b−qbq vanish provided that\nu2\nq + v2\nq\n2vquq\n=\n1\ntanh(2θq)\n= 1 +\nL3\nNV2r3\n0\n¯ h\n2q2\n2M\n.

(22) with\nMc2 =\nNV2r3\n0\nL3 . (33)\nThe ground state implicit in this solution is a highly\n“entangled” state in which the number of bosons with\nmomentum q is correlated with the number at −q.

(34)\nThe expressions for uq and vq may also be obtained by\nadopting a ground state of this form as a variational\nansatz and minimizing the expected energy with respect\nto vq/uq. They may also be obtained by minimizing the\nground state energy implicit in Eq.

The pressure increases toward the bottom\nof the tank and eventually reaches, and surpasses, the critical\nvalue. Sound quanta generated by a transducer are refracted\ntoward this “horizon” and stall there, just as light does near\na classical Schwarzschild event horizon. On the right are the\npressure proﬁle given by Eq. (37) and the sound velocity\nproﬁle given by Eq. (38).\nVII. CRITICAL EVENT HORIZON\nLet us now turn to the black hole paradox. Rather than\ntrying to resolve the problem by promoting a speciﬁc the-\nory of gravity, which is probably not falsiﬁable anyway,\nlet us use our understanding of quantum ﬂuids to estab-\nlish a simple point: Zero-temperature phase transitions\ngenerate the same kinds of apparent illogic one ﬁnds at\nblack hole surfaces. This result is very general and thus\nalso applies to candidate microscopic theories of gravity.\nImagine a thought experiment, illustrated in Fig. 6, in\nwhich a tall tank on the surface of the earth is ﬁlled with\na zero-temperature quantum ﬂuid described by a critical\nequation of state - for example, Eq. (16) with d = 8a/27b.\nThe pressure increases toward the bottom of the tank\ndue to gravity and, at some critical depth, reaches, and\nthen surpasses, the critical pressure pc = a/27b2. If we\nnow stimulate the system near the critical surface with a\nsound transducer, the injected quanta will be attracted\nby the surface because the propagation speed is lower\nthere. This is the exactly same eﬀect as refraction of light\ntoward the center of a lens or of ocean waves toward a\nbeach—or the gravitational attraction of light by a black\nhole. For both the critical surface and the black hole\nhorizon this speed actually vanishes, causing the waves\nto stall and never reach the surface in ﬁnite time. How-\never, this paradox has a simple resolution in the case of\nthe ﬂuid: The coherence length ξ diverges to inﬁnity as\none approaches the horizon, and the laws of quantum hy-\ndrodynamics fail. The waves cease to have all meaning as\ncompressional sound and begin doing things disallowed\nby hydrodynamics, such as decay and thermalize.\nLet us now consider the possibility that this analogy\nmight be apt rather than just interesting. Pathologies in\nthe ultraviolet are one of the central problems of general\nrelativity. We presently have no way to resolve them,\nand the diﬃculties are so severe that there is serious talk\nabout a need to change the laws of quantum mechanics23.\nMoreover the existing experimental record says nothing\nabout this matter because it does not extend to the\nPlanck scale. It certainly does not preclude possibil-\nity that relativity might simply fail at the event horizon\nthrough the divergence of a coherence length. Since dis-\ntinguishing an emergent phenomenon from a fundamen-\ntal one at long wavelengths is impossible, this amounts\nto a serious logical ﬂaw in the way we normally think\nabout relativity. It obligates us to take seriously the pos-\nsibility that black hole horizons may be phase transitions\nof the vacuum of space-time, that they are described in-\naccurately by the Einstein ﬁeld equations in the same\nway that critical surfaces are inaccurately described by\nquantum hydrodynamics, and that elevation of relativity\nto a position of transcendence is the source of the entire\nproblem. Were this the case, it would instantly resolve\nall incompatibilities between general relativity and quan-\ntum mechanics, including the unitarity of the scattering\nmatrix and the loss-of-information paradox.\nThe analogy between the critical surface and the black\nhole horizon may be made quite precise. In terms of the\ncritical density ρc = M(3b)−1/2 we have for the equation\nof state near criticality\np\npc\n− 1 = 12(\nρ\nρc\n− 1)3 . (35)\nSince the force of gravity is just a device for achieving a\ndensity increase, we are allowed to weaken gravity at the\ncritical surface according to the rule\ng = g0(1 − e−z\n2/ℓ\n2\n) , (36)\nin order to improve the black hole analogy. We then have\np\npc\n≃ 1 −\ng0\n2ℓ2c2\n0\nz3 , (37)\nwhere c0 =\np\npc/ρc is a velocity scale, and\nc ≃ (\n6c0g0\nℓ2 )\n1/3|z| =\n|z|\nτ\n. (38)\nThis is precisely the rule with which the speed of light,\nmeasured with a clock at inﬁnity, vanishes at the event\nhorizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. Classical hydrody-\nnamics predicts that small density ﬂuctuations δρ prop-\nagate near the critical surface according as\n∇   [c2∇(δρ)] =\n∂2(δρ)\n∂t2 . (39)8\nThis is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the scalar wave\nequation\n∇   [c∇φ] =\n1\nc\n∂2φ\n∂t2 (40)\none obtains from\n∂\n∂x (\n√\n−g g\n ν ∂φ\n∂xν ) = 0 (41)\nusing the gravitational metric\nds2 = g νdx dxν = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 − c2dt2 . (42)\nFailure by means of a diverging coherence length is so\nsubtle that there is a precise sense in which the failure\ndoes not occur at all. The issue is an order of limits.\nSuppose we play a game in which you ﬁrst declare how\nclose to the critical surface you wish to go, then I look\nfor a frequency at which hydrodynamics works all the\nway down to this height. If we do things in this order\nthen I always win, since I can always pick the frequency\nsuﬃciently low that ωξ/c << 1 on your surface. If we\ndo a proper experiment, on the other hand, in which you\nﬁrst ﬁx the frequency and then I search for the height at\nwhich hydrodynamics fails, then I always lose. Thus if\nblack hole horizons were like critical surfaces then there\nwould be a precise sense in which general relativity was\nexactly true in all regions of space-time accessible to us.\nIt would also be highly misleading. Our game shows in a\nphysical way that knowledge of the classical ﬁeld theory\nemerging in the q,ω → 0 limit is not suﬃcient for pre-\ndicting all low-energy things near a phase boundary. We\nmust also understand the ultraviolet behavior. An im-\nproper regularization—which is what this improper order\nof limits amounts to—can lead to physical nonsense.\nVIII. EXPERIMENTAL SIGNATURES\nLet us now discuss some experimental properties of the\nquantum ﬂuid and its critical surface that might have\nanalogs in quantum gravity and thus lead to observa-\ntional tests of these ideas on real black holes.\nA. Hydrodynamic Failure at High Energies\nThe failure of hydrodynamics at the critical surface is a\nspeciﬁc case of a more general eﬀect of ultraviolet break-\ndown. Since hydrodynamics is emergent it must fail in a\nmeasurement of the “vacuum” far from the critical sur-\nface, either through a deviation from relation ω = cq\nor an otherwise disallowed decay, at some characteristic\nscale ξ. The properties at this scale must evolve adia-\nbatically to lower energies as the critical surface is ap-\nproached, and eventually evolve into the critical proper-\nties.\nB. Transparency\nLet us return now to Fig. 6 and consider what happens\nto the acoustic energy beamed into the critical region.\nPart of the answer is suggested by Fig. 5, which shows\nthat a sound quantum penetrating into the critical region\nmight morph adiabatically into a free boson, traverse the\nregion in ﬁnite time, and emerge intact from the other\nside. To quantify this eﬀect, however, we must evaluate\nthe rate at which a boson in the critical region decays.\nThis may be thought of either as an acoustic nonlinearity\nor knocking extra bosons out of the condensate. At the\ncritical point the lagrangian is eﬀectively\nL = ψ\n∗(i¯ h\n∂\n∂t\n+ )ψ−\n¯ h\n2\n2M\n|∇ψ|\n2+3pcv\n2\nc(|ψ|\n2−ψ\n2\n0)\n4. (43)\nThe corresponding quantum hamiltonian is\nH =\nX\nq\n¯ h\n2q2\n2M\na†\nqaq +\n3pcv2\nc\nL3\nX\nq1q2q3q4\n×δ(q1 + q2 + q3 + q4)(aq1 + a\n†\n−q1)(aq2 + a\n†\n−q2)\n× (aq3 + a\n†\n−q3)(aq4 + a\n†\n−q4) . (44)\nThe extremely high order of the nonlinearity means that\nthe fastest decay process is emission of two extra bosons.\nThe contribution of this process to the imaginary part of\nthe boson self-energy is\nImΣq(ω) = 12(\n3pcv2\nc\nL3 )2 X\nq1q2\nIm\n￿\n¯ hω\n−\n¯ h\n2\n2M\n(|q1|2 + |q2|2 + |q1 + q2 + q|2) + iǫ\n￿−1\n= −\n3\n√\n3\n4π2 (\nM\n¯ h\n2)3(pcv2\nc)2(¯ hω−\n¯ h\n2q2\n6M\n)2Θ(¯ hω−\n¯ h\n2q2\n6M\n). (45)\nThus the decay rate for a boson of energy ¯ hω = ¯ h\n2q2/2M\nis\n¯ h\nτrad\n=\n2\n√\n3π2(\nM\n¯ h\n2)3(pcv2\nc)2(¯ hω)2 . (46)\nThis implies that the free boson becomes more and more\nsharply deﬁned as its energy is lowered, so that in the\nlow-energy limit one retrieves the ideal noninteracting\nbose gas24.\nThe condition for transparency is τ < τrad, where τ\nis deﬁned by Eq. (38). The reason is that the time it\ntakes the boson to traverse the critical region is always τ,\nregardless of its energy. The width of the critical region\ngrows with the boson’s momentum as ¯ hqτ/M, but the\nvelocity also grows as ¯ hq/M, and the two eﬀects cancel.9\n0\n0\n.\n0\n5\n0\n.\n1\n0\n0\n.\n1\n0\n.\n2\n0\n.\n3\n0\n.\n4\nd\n \n|\n|\nd\n￿\nd\n \n0\n \n0\n \n \nFIG. 7: Diﬀerential cross-section for prompt ﬂuorescence de-\nﬁned by Eq. (47). The bosons are assumed to be normally\nincident at frequency ω. The various curves are diﬀerent val-\nues of θ ranging from 0 to π/2. The maximum value of ω\n′/ω\nfor radiation returned normally (θ = 0) is 1/9.\nC. Critical Opalescence\nIf the critical surface is at temperature T then there\nis a second decay process in which the boson scatters\noﬀ of another boson thermally excited into the vacuum.\nThis corresponds to conventional critical opalescence. It\nis straightforward to calculate, but we shall just state\nthe result here. Up to factors of order 1, the rate as the\nsame as in Eq. (46) except for the substitution (¯ hω)2 →\n(kBT)3/2(¯ hω)1/2. Thus for frequenceis much larger than\nkBT/¯ h this process is irrelevant.\nThis has the interesting and important implication\nthat the ratio τrad/τ determines whether the critical sur-\nface is optically thin or thick. When this parameter is\nmuch less than 1 the surface is very thin, and therefore\nnot “black”.\nD. Prompt Fluorescence\nThere is a net probability of about 0.06 that one of\nthe bosons created in a decay will escape back out of\nthe surface. This ﬂuorescence signal is prompt and has a\ncharacteristic spectral shape. Let us assume for simplic-\nity that τrad < τ, so that all the quanta impinging on the\nsurface decay. In the opposite case one just reduces the\nsignal by the decay fraction. Let us also assume that the\nbosons are normally incident at frequency ω. Then the\ndiﬀerential cross-section per unit area A of the surface to\nscatter back into solid angle dΩ and between frequency\nω′ and ω′ + dω′ is\ndσ\ndΩdω′ =\n27A\n16π2ω\nq\n3x[1 − 3x − 2\n√\nxcos(θ)] , (47)\nwhere x = ω′/ω and θ is the polar angle of exit just above\nthe critical region, i.e. before the signal is defocused by\noutward refraction.

DE SITTER INTERIOR\nIn order to talk experimentally about real black holes\nit is now necessary for me to speculate about what is\ninside them. This is extremely dangerous since, as we\nhave discussed, it is fundamentally impossible to infer the\nnature of one phase from low-energy measurements made\non another. However, in order to stimulate thinking on\nwhat kinds of measurement one could proﬁtably do on\nthe black hole itself it is necessary to be concrete, and this\nrequires that we specify what happens when one crosses\nthe horizon.\nI shall presume that that the analogy with Fig. 6 is\nliterally correct. Catastrophic jumps of the metric char-\nacteristic of a ﬁrst-order transition cannot be ruled out\non any logical basis, nor can a non-relativistic equation of\nstate inside the black hole. However, a continuous transi-\ntion does the least violence to classical general relativity\nand allows the Einstein ﬁeld equations to be valid, in\nthe limited sense we have described, everywhere experi-\nmentally accessible to us. If the analogy is apt then the\nrelevant emergent principle - in this case relativity - must\nbe restored on the other side of the surface in a mirror-\nsymmetric way. This means that the metric must exist\non the other side, satisfy the Einstein ﬁeld equations, and\nbe characterized by a speed of light, measured by clocks\nat inﬁnity, that increases with distance from the horizon,\njust as the sound speed does on the other side of the\ncritical surface. As shown in Fig. 9, this does not leave\none much ﬂexibility. The boundary conditions at r = 0\nrequire the black hole to contain positive energy density\nbut negative pressure. This is the characteristic feature\nof de Sitter space. Indeed for the the speciﬁc metric\nds2 = γ(r)dr2 + r2dΩ2 − c2γ(r)dt2 , (52)\nthe choice of cosmological-constant matter\nR ν −\n1\n2\ng νR =\n￿\n3r−2\ns g ν r < rs\n0 r > rs\n￿\n, (53)\nwhere rs = 2GM/c2, with M the black hole mass, works\nnicely, and we obtain\nγ(r) =\n￿\n1 − (r/rs)2 r < rs\n1 − rs/r r > rs\n￿\n(54)\nThis leads to the interesting idea that the two phases\nmight be distinguished by the values of their cosmological\nconstants.\nAn important experimental consequence of this solu-\ntion is that there would be a local measurement capable of\ndetecting proximity to a black hole. Black hole horizons\ncannot be phase transitions unless the relativity principle\nitself is emergent. Einstein gravity is based on very little\nother than the principles of relativity and equivalence,\nso if both of these are true then the predictions of clas-\nsical general relativity must also be true—notably that\nblack holes must form in the conventional way and not be\nanalogous to the critical surface. Thus relativity would\nhave to fail at suﬃciently high energy scales whether one\nwere near the black hole or not. The energy scale of this\nfailure—the ultraviolet cutoﬀ of the theory—would be\nboth measurable and position-dependent. Its lowering to\nzero would signal proximity to the event horizon.\nA reasonable guess for the scale at which the princi-\nples of emergence should fail is the Planck length ξp =\n(¯ hG/c3)1/2 = 1.61 × 10−33 cm. However, here one must\nbe cautious. The superﬂuid analog of Newton’s constant\nis the inverse mass density ρ−1. This is determined by\nadding the term\nδL = V2a3\n￿\n|ψ(r)|2 + |ψ(−r)|2\n￿\n(55)\nto the lagrangian of Eq. (11), and then inducing acoustic\nradiation by moving the parameter r(t) in a circular orbit\nof radius ℓ/2 at frequency ω. After some algebra one ﬁnds\nthe power radiated to be\nP =\n1\n5πρc5M2ℓ4ω8 , (56)11\nwhere M is the mass accumulated around r by the po-\ntential. The corresponding quantity in Einstein gravity\nis\nP =\n2\n15\nG\nc5M2ℓ4ω6 . (57)\nThe disparity in the powers of ω comes from the fact\nthat hydrodynamics is a monopolar theory while grav-\nity is quadrupolar. Combining the mass density and\nthe sound speed dimensionally into a length, one obtains\n(Mc/¯ hv)1/4 = η1/4ξ, where η = ξ3/v. Unfortunately\nthe dimensionless constant η cannot be measured in any\nq,ω → 0 experiment. If η ≃ 1, as is the case in super-\nﬂuid 4He, then dimensional analysis gives a reasonable\nestimate of ξ. Otherwise it does not.\nThis model suggests that cosmological black holes may\nbe optically thin, and thus not “black” at all. For a\nsolar-mass black hole (M = 2 × 1033 gm) we have [cf.\nEq. (38)] rs = 3.0 km and τ = 2rs/c = 2.0 × 10−5 sec.\nTo estimate τrad let us assume that the vacuum far from\nthe black hole is analogous to the quiescent ﬂuid, and\nthat η = 1 there, so that the coherence length ξ can be\ndetermined by dimensional analysis and thus equals the\nPlanck length. Let us further assume that the equivalent\nﬂuid density and pressure are not far from their values at\nthe critical point, so that pcvc is Planck energy Mpc2 =\n¯ hc/ξ and M is the Planck mass Mp. Then we have\nτrad =\n√\n3π2c\nξpω2 =\n3.2 × 1044 sec−1\nω2 , (58)\nwhere ω is the frequency far away from the black hole.\nThus the horizon would be transparent to gravitons\n(and presumably any other particle) of energy less than\n¯ hωmax = 2.6×109 eV. Were this the case, the black hole\nwould look like a powerful defocusing lens.\nThe most important diﬀerence between the model of\nFig. 9 and a traditional black hole is its ﬁnite speciﬁc\nheat. From Eq. (51) we ﬁnd that the total thermal en-\nergy contained at the horizon of a black hole at temper-\nature T, measured at inﬁnity, is\nE = 8ζ(3)(\nrs kBT\n¯ h\n)3 M\nc\n. (59)\nIt is absolutely clear that the cold quantum critical sur-\nface does not radiate, since it is in its ground state, and\nit is also clear that the surface may be raised to arbitrary\ntemperatures by adding heat. Thus this analogy is funda-\nmentally at odds with Hawking’s prediction that a black\nhole should emit thermal radiation with a temperature\nproportional to its mass25. Unruh26 showed a number of\nyears ago that traditional Hawking radiation is emitted\nfrom caustic surfaces of transsonic superﬂuid ﬂows, and\nJacobson and Volovik27 have recently made a good case\nthat this also occurs at “superluminal” solitonic domain\nwalls of superﬂuids. The long-wavelength description of\nthese systems is identical to that of the critical surface\ndiscussed here, but the ultraviolet description is diﬀer-\nent. Since Hawking’s regularization procedure has no\nmicroscopic justiﬁcation there is reason for concern that\nhis result may be an artifact of ﬁctitious motion encoded\nin the cutoﬀ procedure. The heat capacity implicit in\nEq. (59) is large. The temperature at which this energy\nequals Mc2 for a solar-mass black hole is kBT = 141 eV.\nThe event horizon in this model contains a large zero-\ntemperature stress, or negative surface tension, like that\nin a steel pressure vessel, holding back the negative pres-\nsure of the cosmological-constant matter on the inside.\nThis, however, is arguably a symptom of the breakdown\nof relativity and not physically meaningful stress. It is\nnot detectable in any measurement performed on the out-\nside other than the the ﬂuorescence and reﬂection struc-\nture shown in Figs. 7 and 8, nor does it exist in any region\nof space-time where Einstein gravity is valid (on length\nscales longer than ξ). It resides only on an inﬁnitely thin\nsurface at which ξ has diverged to inﬁnity and neither the\nmetric nor the curvature tensor is deﬁned on any scale. If\none insists on thinking of this stress conventionally then\nit is large. For any choice of γ(r), conservation of momen-\ntum requires the radial pressure jump across the surface\nto satisfy\n∆T\nr\nr =\n1\nr0\nZ r0+ǫ\nr0−ǫ\n(T\nθ\nθ + T\nφ\nφ − 2T\nr\nr)dr\n=\n1\n2r2\n0\nZ √\nr0ǫ\n−\n√\nr0ǫ\n(T\nθ\nθ + T\nφ\nφ − 2T\nz\nz )|z|dz =\n3\n4π\nM\nr3\ns\n.

CONCLUSION\nMy lecture today has been intentionally iconoclastic,\nand I hope you will all take it in the spirit of fun and as\na starting point for reﬂection about the gravity problem\nin new ways. It has been my experience that good theo-\nretical physics is empowering, in that it enables thinking\nto take place that would otherwise not occur, and, in its\nhighest form, facilitates experiments that would other-\nwise not be done. This is a diﬃcult and often dangerous\ntask, as we are paid to be technicians, not visionaries,\nand can be just as severely punished for political incor-\nrectness as a governor or congressman. However, this12\nactivity is the most important thing we do, and perhaps\neven the only important thing we do, for experimental-\nists are usually smart enough to model for themselves but\ncannot take expensive risks without help. For those of\nyou younger than I am and feeling a bit unsure about how\nthis all works, let me assure you of one of the great truths\nof our discipline: Experimentalists are amazing and won-\nderful people. They have clever tricks you or I could\nnever guess and are always on the prowl for something\nto earn them glory. Communicating important ideas to\nthem in a clear and courageous way is the best way I\nknow both to earn one’s keep and to generate science\nthat lasts.\nAcknowledgments\nThe ideas discussed in this manuscript were worked\nout collaboratively with my original co-authors George\nChapline, Evan Hohlfeld, and David Santiago1, to whom\nI am most grateful for their friendship, enthusiasm, and\nﬁerce professionalism.

Introduction\nThe famous issues of Newtonian absolute space and time were followed by many\nconstructive critiques of relationalists. The most eﬃcient works of this kind were\ndue to the Ernst Mach, the contemporary physicist and philosopher[1]. Various\naspects of Mach’s ideas concerning the motion , from Newton’s bucket to quantum\ngravity, have been collected in the proceeding of the conference held at T¨ ubingen\n(July 1993) for this purpose[2]. Also among recent references the reader is refered\nto the works of Assis and Ghosh [3,4].\nIn his critique of Newtonian mechanics(NM), Mach arrived at the following two\nconclusions:\ni) - Only the relative motion of a body with respect to other bodies is observable,\nnot motion with regard to absolute space.\nii) - The inertial motion of a body is inﬂuenced by all the masses in the Universe.\n1To appreciate fully these two physically pleasant ideas we have applied them in\na proposed classical model of inertia[5]. In this model we consider the inertia as a\nreal two body interaction. For a system of two particles 1 and 2, in an arbitrary\nnon-rotating reference frame S, this force is proportional to the diﬀerence of their\naccelerations with respect to S and to the inertial charges of each particle as follows:\n  Finertia =  c1c2(  a1 −  a2) (1)\nHere   is a coupling constant , c1 and c2 represent the inertial charges of particles\n1 and 2 respectively and (  a1 and   a2) are their accelerations with respect to S. In a\nsystem consisting of N particles the total force imposed on the ith particle is :\n  Fi =  ci\nN  \nj=1\ncj(  ai −  aj) (2)\nwhere the index i referes to the particle i and the summation is over all particles.\nBy defenition in the real world the inertial charge and the Newtonian inertial mass\nof a particle are related as follows:\nmi =  ci\nall  \nj=1\ncj. (3)\nSummation is taken over all particles in the Universe. This means that the inertial\nmass of a particle (say labelled j) depends on its own feature (cj) and a global eﬀect\nof all particles in the world(\nall  \nj=1\ncj) . This may be considered as a simple formulation\nof Mach’s idea concerning inertia. Since local inhomogenities have no observed eﬀect\non the inertial mass then it is accepted that the inertial mass is determined by the\nglobal structure of the Universe and this is exactly expressed by Eq.(3). Rewriting\nEq.(2) in terms of the inertial masses yields a modiﬁed form of the Newton’s second\nlaw, i.e.,\n  Fi = mi\n\n\n\n\n  ai −\nall  \nj=1\nmj  aj\nall  \nj=1\nmj\n\n\n\n\n (4)\nAs it is evident these equations are invariant under a more general transformation\nthan Galilean’s. These transformations may be called generalized Galilean transfor-\nmations with the form: \n    \n    \nt\n′\n= t\n  a\n′ =   a −  b\n  u\n′\n=   u −  bt −  v\n  x\n′ =   x − 1\n2\n  bt2 − t  v +   x0\n(5)\n2where  b,   v and   x0 are constant acceleration ,velocity and position of S\n′\nwith respect\nto S at t = 0 respectively.\nEq.(4) satisﬁes full Machian aspects. The one which is of interest is that the so-\ncalled absolute space is just the frame attached to the center of mass of the Universe\nin which the Newtonian second law,   Fi = mi  ai is recovered. The main feature of\nthis model from a Machian point of view is its relational nature, so that the presence\nof each particle in the Universe and its location relative to the others determine the\ninertial reference frames. It is seen that Eqs. (2) and (4) also satisfy Newton’s third\nlaw automatically. For a two particle system we have   F1 = −  F2 and for a system\nwith N particles they make\nN  \ni=1\n  Fi = 0.\nWe may also extend this model to gravity. Equivalence principle here means that\nthe source of inertia and gravitation is the same. Let us deﬁne the gravitational force\nbetween two particles of inertial charges c1 and c2 as:\n|  FG| =\n 2c1c2\n|  r12|2 (6)\nThen we can express gravitational constant G in terms of inertial charges cis;\nG =\n\n\nall  \nj=1\ncj\n\n\n−2\n(7)\nor\nG =\n \nall  \nj=1\nmj\n(8)\nEqs. (7) and (8) show that G as a global eﬀect is resulted from all inertial charges\nand we may infer that\nall  \nj=1\ncj is ﬁnite. According to the Mach’s ideas the so-called\nphysical constants (including G) should be determined from global features of the\nUniverse. Thus Eqs. (7) and (8) reveal the very feature of a good Machian model.\nThe Lagrangian function from which Eq.(4) may be extracted is simply obtained\nby following the canonical procedure of D’Alembert’s principle. Starting from Eq.(4)\nand restricting ourselves to systems for which the virtual work of the forces of\nconstraint vanishes we obtain\n \ni\n\n\n\n\n\n  Fi − mi\n\n\n\n\n  ai −\nall  \nj=1\nmj  aj\nall  \nj=1\nmj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   δ  ri = 0, (9)\n3which is the new form of D’Alembert principle. Here δ  ris are inﬁnitesimal changes\nof coordinates as the result of virtual displacement of the system. This leads to the\nresult just like the one in ordinary NM except that the kinetic energy T that is equal\nto\n \ni\n1\n2mivi\n2 should be replaced by:\nT =\n \ni\n1\n2\nmiv\n2\ni −\n \n \ni\nmivi\n 2\n2\n \ni\nmi\n(10)\n=\n1\n4\n \ni\n \nj\nmimj\n(  vi −  vj)2\n \nk\nmk\nIndeed the diﬀerence is the second term in the ﬁrst row and is just the kinetic energy\nof the center of mass which is canceld out in this model. This is well justiﬁed when\nis applied in cosmology. Where we are dealing with the whole Universe, motion and\nkinetic energy of its center of mass have no physical meaning.\nThe new form of T as a function of the magnitude of relative velocities of par-\nticles has a scalar invariant manner. Then as an other advantage in this model the\nLagrangian and Hamitonian of a system are scalar invariants from point of view of\na nonrotating observer.\nL =\n1\n4\n \ni\n \nj\nmimj\n(  vi −  vj)2\n \nk\nmk\n− V (rij) (11)\nIt is noticeable that in a diﬀerent way to obtain a relational NM Eq.(11) has been\nproposed by Lynden-Bell[6,7].\nWe may summarize the Machian features of this model as follows:\n1. The relational nature of this model is so that by considerng relational distances\nthere is no need to assume absolute space or inertial frame. Indeed the so-called\ninertial frame is the frame attached to the center of mass of the Universe. Then\nexistance of each particle and its location with respect to others determine the\ninertial frames.\n2. Inertial mass of each particle depends on its own inertial charge and the sum\nof inertial charges of all particles in the world. It is not a natural constant ,\nand may change whenever the total inertial charge of the world undergoes any\nchange(e.g. in pair production era).\n43. Gravitational constant G is related to the sum of all inertial charges existing\nin the Universe and as a global eﬀect each individual paticle shares in its\nconstruction. Just like inertial mass , this may be changed whenever the total\ninertial charge of the world faces with changes.\n4. The concept of energy in this model is independent of measuring reference\nframe and is an invariant scalar quantity.\n5. For an empty universe it does predict no structure.\nCollection of these features in the above model provides us a suitable guide to\ncontinue and achieve a modiﬁed theory of relativity, i.e. a theory of relativity without\nany non-Machian shortcoming, what we may call as relational relativity(RR). As a\nﬁrst step toward RR it is convinient to begin with special relativity (SR).\nII. Relational Special Relativity\nAt the begining it should be noticed that according to the Eqs. (7) and (8) it\nis possible to assume a world without inertia via vanishing the coupling constant  ,\nbut the assumption of a world without gravitation is physically impossible. Then\nthe subject of special relativity because of its ignorance of gravitation is under ques-\ntion and cannot be considered as a global theory from a Machian standpoint. In\nspite of this we try to present a relational special theory of relativity.\nAlthough Michelson-Morley experiment rejects the concept of ether but SR still\nis based on the same assumption of the existence of absolute space and preference of\ninertial frames as NM. In a relational approach we may remove the need for absolute\nspace in SR. To do this task some preliminary remarks should be mentioned.\nIn NM the Lagrangian of a free particle is just the kinetic energy and its action is\nS =\n \ndt(\n1\n2\nm˙ x\n2). (12)\nwhere ˙ x is the velocity of the particle with mass m. In SR this is changed to the\nfollowing form\nS = −m\n \ndt(1 − ˙ x\n2)\n1\n2 = −m\n \nds (13)\nso that in low velocity limit (˙ x ≪ 1) the equation of motion returns to the Newtonian\nform. Other form of this relation in terms of space-time metric is\nS = −m\n \ndt\n \ngµν\ndxµ\ndt\ndxν\ndt\n  1\n2\n. (14)\n5That is the Lagrangian is as follows\nL = −m(gµν ˙ x\nµ ˙ x\nν)\n1\n2 (15)\nwhere gµν = ηµν i.e., just the Minkowski metric.\nAccording to the deﬁnition of canonical momentum we have\npα =\n∂L\n∂ ˙ xα = −\nmηαµ ˙ xµ\n(ηµν ˙ xµ ˙ xν)\n1\n2\n= −mηαµu\nµ (16)\nwhere by deﬁnition dxµ\nds = uµ.\nThen the equation of motion has the form\nm˙ uα = 0. (17)\nFor a system of N particles with masses ma ,a = 1,2,..N is made by deﬁning\nthe action as\nS = −\nN  \na=1\nma\n \n(ηµν\ndxµ\na\ndp\n∂xν\na\ndp\n)\n1\n2dp (18)\nwhere p is an aﬃne parameter and the Lagrangian is:\nL = −\nN  \na=1\nma(ηµν\ndxµ\na\ndp\ndxν\na\ndp\n)\n1\n2. (19)\nWe should add two other primary remarks about geometrical and physical points.\nWith physical point we mean a point mass but a geometrical point need not contain\nany matter. We should insist in this fact that a distance measurement is only made\nbetween two physical points. So in presenting the line element deﬁnition instead\nof measuring the distance of physical points with respect to an arbitrary origin\nwe should deﬁne it in terms of the distance between physical points (or physically\nsigniﬁcant points e.g. center of mass of a system). Certainly this deﬁnition has\nhigher Machian(Relational) validity. Now from this point of view let us deﬁne the\nline element ds2\na for a noninteracting N particle system as:\nds\n2\na = ηµν\n\n\ndxa\nµ −\n \nb\nmbdxb\nµ\n \nb\nmb\n\n\n\n\n\ndxa\nν −\n \nb\nmbdxb\nν\n \nb\nmb\n\n\n (20)\nwhere index (a) refers to the particle labeled (a). Then the related action and\nLagrangian are:\nS = −\n \na\nma\n \n[ηµν(\ndxµ\na\ndp\n−\n \nb\nmb\ndx\nµ\nb\ndp\n \nb\nmb\n)(\ndxν\na\ndp\n−\n \nb\nmb\ndxν\nb\ndp\n \nb\nmb\n)]\n1\n2dt (21)\n6L = −\n \na\nma\n \nηµν\n \ndxµ\na\ndp\n−\ndxµ\ncm\ndp\n   \ndxν\na\ndp\n−\ndxν\ncm\ndp\n   1\n2\n. (22)\nThe canonical momentum of the kth particle is\n(pk)α =\n∂L\n∂\ndxα\nk\ndp\n= −ηανmk\n(\ndxν\nk\ndp −\ndxν\ncm\ndp )\ndsk\ndp\n= −ηανmk(u\nν\nk − u\nν\ncm)\n= −mk((uk)α − (ucm)α). (23)\nSince ∂L\n∂xα\nk\n= 0 and d\ndp(pk)α = −mkηαν(\nduν\nk\ndp −\nduν\ncm\ndp ) , then the equation of motion of\nthe kth particle is\n  duk\ndp\n−\n  ducm\ndp\n= 0 (24)\nwhich is just the same as the modiﬁed form (4) in the Newtonian limit.\nThe Lagrangian (22) is written without any coordination with respect to a priori\nﬁxed virtual absolute space and these are particles by their own relative locations\nthat determine it. This is free from that non-Machian aspects suﬀering the standard\nSR. So we may call the relativistic theory based on this Lagrangian as relational\nspecial relativity.\nIII. Relational General Relativity\nIt seems the same approach may be followed to obtain the relational GR. But this\nis not so straightforward. Because to extrapolate this result to GR, i.e. to change\nthe Minkowskian ﬂat space-time (ηµν) into the Riemannian curved space-time (gµν),\ncare should be taken of dealing with vector quantities. Summation of the vectors\nin this case needs parallel transportation of them which in turn requires to deﬁne\nthe path of transportation for each of them. To achieve a relational theory of GR\nit requires choosing another strategy with some diﬀerent approach as follows.\nInitially we remark the center of mass(CM) concept in NM. With the help of\nthis concept in the Eucledian space NM of a single particle can be extrapolated\nand be applied to a system with N particles. The classical meaning of CM losses\nits uniqueness when enters in the realm of relativity so that diﬀerent observers ﬁnd\ndiﬀerent points as CM of a given system. The important point worthy to notice\nabout CM is its dual character from a Machian point of view so that despite of its\ngreat value as a technical tool to present the relational motion on the other hand as a\npoint in which total mass of the system is located and its motion is to be considered\nis quite anti-Machian concept. A single point has no motion and no inertia.\n7Turning back to the NM we may deﬁne the center of inertial charge (CI). By\ndeﬁnition:\nX\nµ\nCI =\n \ni\n \nj\ncicj(x\nµ\ni + x\nµ\nj)\n2(\n \nj\ncj)2\n=\n \ni\nmix\nµ\ni\n \ni\nmi\n= X\nµ\nCM (25)\nwhere X\nµ\nCM and X\nµ\nCI are coordinates of CM and CI respectively. As it is evident\nthe concept of CI has also a mutually relational content between particles.\nNow it is easy to show that the result (4) may be obtained with the help of La-\ngrangian formalism in NM and imposing the following condition on CI;\nδX\nµ\nCI ≡ 0 (26)\nBecause\nδX\nµ\nCI =\n \ni\nmiδx\nµ\ni = 0 , (27)\nand imposing this by using the method of undetermined Lagrangian multipliers in\nvariations of the action of a system with N noninteractiong particles , yields:\nδI =\n \nn\n \ndt[mn¨ x\nµ\nn + fmn]δx\nµ\nn ≡ 0 (28)\nwhere the coeﬃcient f is determined as follows:\nf = −\n \nn\nmn¨ xµ\nn\n \nn\nmn\n(29)\nThus the equation of motion (4) is obtained. Also with consideration of the con-\ndition (27) in variation of the action (18)in special relativity the result (22) may be\nobtained.\nTo remove the Machian objection to the concept of CM the following condition\nas a Machian condition may be imposed to the variations of the dynamical variables\nxµ\nν of the system. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne Xµ as\nX\nµ ≡\n \nn\nmnx\nµ\nn. (30)\nOf course Xµ is not a vector quantity and depends to the chosen reference frame.\nLet us denote its variations withδXµ:\nδX\nµ ≡\n \nn\nmnδx\nµ\nn (31)\n8HereδXµ is not vector while δxµ\nns are vectors. Similarly δXµ is deﬁned as follows:\nδXµ ≡\n \nn\nmngµλ(xn)δx\nλ\nn (32)\nNow as a Machian principle we postulate that allways δXµ vanishes(lower index\nis chosen only for convenience). This means that variations of dynamical variables\nxµ\nn are under the following condition:\n \nn\nmngµλ(xn)δx\nλ\nn = 0 (33)\nDespite of this fact that (33) is not a covariant condition we can make the best\nuse of it to ﬁnd at least a clue for the geodesic equations in GR.\nMatter action for a system consisting of N particles with masses mn is given by\nthe following form in GR;\nI =\n \nn\nmn\n \ndp\n \ngµν(xn(p))\ndxµ\nn(p)\ndp\ndxν\nn\ndp\n  1\n2\n(34)\nwhere p is some quantity that simultaneously parametrizes all the space-time tra-\njectories of the various particles.\nVariation of the action (34) due to an inﬁnitesimal variation in the dynamical\nvariables xµ → xµ(p) + δxµ(p) is given by:\nδI =\n1\n2\n \nn\nmn\n \ndp[gµν(xn(p))\ndxµ\nn(p)\ndp\ndxν\nn(p)\ndp\n]\n− 1\n2\n×\n \n2gµν(xn(p))\ndxµ\nn(p)\ndp\ndδxν\nn(p)\ndp\n+\n \n∂gµν(x)\n∂xλ\n \nx=xn(p)\ndxµ\nn(p)\ndp\ndxν\nn\ndp\nδx\nλ\nn(p)\n\n\n (35)\nIt is convenient to change variables of integration (35) from p to the τn (the proper\ntime of the particle n) deﬁned by:\ndτn ≡ (gµνdx\nµ\nndx\nν\nn)\n1\n2 (36)\nSo the integral in (35) may be written in a simpler form:\nδI =\n1\n2\n \nn\nmn\n \ndτn\n \n2gµλ(xn)\ndxµ\nn\ndτn\ndδxλ\nn\ndτn\n+\n∂gµν(xn)\n∂xλ\nn\ndxµ\nn\ndτn\ndxν\nn\ndτn\nδx\nλ\nn\n \n(37)\n9Finally integration by parts of the ﬁrst term in (37) with the condition that\nδxµ(τn) vanishes on the boundaries of integration yields that :\nδI =\n \nn\n \ndτngµλ(xn)\n \nmn(\nd2xµ\nn\ndτ2\nn\n+ Γ\nµ\nρσ\ndxρ\nn\ndτn\ndxσ\nn\ndτn\n)\n \nδx\nλ\nn (38)\nwhere Γµ\nρσ are the second type Christoﬀel symbols. Then according to the principle\nof stationary action, δI vanishes for general variations in the dynamical variables\nδxλ\nn if and only if the dynamical variables obey the geodesic equations:\nd2xµ\nn\ndτ2\nn\n+ Γ\nµ\nρσ\ndxρ\nn\ndτn\ndxσ\nn\ndτn\n= 0 (39)\nNow we repeat the above standard process with consideration of the Machian\ncondition (33) to achieve the equations of motion. To impose the mentioned condi-\ntion with the method of undetermined Lagrangian multipliers it is enough only to\nadd the following term to the variations of the action (34)\n \ndpf\nµ  \nn\nmngµλ(xn)δx\nλ\nn (40)\nwhere fµs are undetermined coeﬃcients and just as in (34) parameter p is an\narbitrary quantity which simultaneously parametrizes the space-time trajectories of\ndiﬀerent particles. Then we have:\nδI =\n \nn\n \ndp\n \nmngµλ(xn)[\n∂p\n∂τn\n(\nd2xµ\nn\ndp2 + Γ\nµ\nρσ\ndxρ\nn\ndp\ndxσ\nn\ndp\n) + f\nµ]\n \nδx\nλ\nn = 0 (41)\nWith fµs determined as:\nf\nµ = −\n \nn\nmn\n∂p\n∂τn(\nd2x\nµ\nn\ndp\ndxσ\nn\ndp )\n \nn\nmn\n(42)\nBecause of the mean operation over all particles fµ is a global quantity.\nTherefore by inserting the value of fµ the Machianized form or the relational\nform of the geodesic equations of motion are derived as follows:\nd2xµ\nn\ndp2 −\n \nj\nmj\n∂τn\n∂τj\nd2x\nµ\nj\ndp2\n \nj\nmj\n+ Γ\nµ\nρσ\ndxρ\nn\ndp\ndxσ\nn\ndp\n−\n \nj\nmj\n∂τn\n∂τj Γµ\nρσ\ndx\nρ\nj\ndp\ndxσ\nj\ndp\n \nj\nmj\n= 0 (43)\n10It reveals that in the weak ﬁeld limit the equations (43) correspond with the\nNewtonian one , because the Christoﬀel symbols vanish and parameters τn in this\nlimit are all the same and are equal to t, then Eq.(43) reduces to the modiﬁed\nNewtonian form Eq.(4).\nNow according to the relational result (43) we may propose the covariant form\nof the geodesic equations as follows:\nd2xµ\nn\ndp2 + Γ\nµ\nρσ\ndxρ\nn\ndp\ndxσ\ndp\n−\n \nj\nmj\n∂τn\n∂τj Uxn\nxj (\nd2x\nµ\nj\ndp2 + Γ\nµ\nalphaβ\ndxα\nj\ndp\ndx\nβ\nj\ndp )\n \nj\nmj\n= 0 (44)\nwhere Uxn\nxj is the parallel transportation operator from the location of the jth par-\nticle to the location of the nth one.\nIV. Remarks\nWe are now staying at a standpoint that may return to the famous question that\n“whether the formalism of general relativity and the Einstein equations are perfectly\nMachian?” and have a strictly positive answer to it. Checking the Machian(or anti-\nMachian) aspects of GR we notice that;\n1. By now in front of the basic question that why the Einstein ﬁeld equations\nhave nontrivial solution ﬂat space Rµν = 0 for empty universe we had to resort\nto the boudary condition reasons. Hereafter, with what we have ﬁnd about\ninertia it is seen that the Einstein ﬁeld equations\nc4\n8πGRµν = (Tµν −\n1\n2gµνT)\npredict 0 = 0 (instead of Rµν = 0)for empty universe. For assuming vacuum\nT , Tµν = 0 makes the RHS of the ﬁeld equations to be equal zero and on the\nother side the coupling constant appears on the LHS as G−1, which in turn\naccording to the relations (7) and (8) depends on the existence of all particles\nin the universe, G ∝ 1  \ni\nmi, so for the empty universe\n \ni\nmi = 0 and thus the\nﬁeld equations yield to 0 = 0, that is a perfectly Machian result.\n2. For a world with a single particle, although the ﬁeld equations based on the\npresented model of inertia predict a solution that is independent of inertial\ncharge and merely depending to the coupling constant  . But for its geodesic\nequation the relations (43) and (44) yield to the result 0 = 0, that means\ndenying any motion for a single particle , an ideal result from a Machian point\nof view.\n11Acknowledgements\nA.M.A. would like to thank Prof. J.

This framework is discussed in three contexts: (i) as\na scenario for superluminal signalling and motion, (ii) as the possibility\nof two or more “light” cones due to the a “birefringent” vaccum, and\n(iii) as a further extension of conventionality beyond synchrony.\n1 General framework\nIn what follows, we shall study two signal types with two diﬀerent signal\nvelocities generating two diﬀerent sets of Lorentz frames associated with two\ntypes of “light” cones. (A generalization to an arbitrary number of signals\nis straightforward.) This may seem implausible and even misleading at ﬁrst,\nsince from two diﬀerent “maximal” signal velocities only one can be truly\nmaximal. Only the maximal one appears to be the natural candidate for the\ngeneration of Lorentz frames.\nHowever, it may sometimes be physically reasonable to consider frames\nobtained by nonmaximal speed signalling. What could such subluminal co-\nordinates, as they may be called, be good for?\n(i) First of all, they may be useful for intermediate description levels\n[6, 54] of physical theory. These description levels may either be irreducible\n1or derivable from some more foundamental level. Such considerations appear\nto be closely related to system science.\n(ii) By analogy, we may also consider faster-than-light “signalling” gen-\nerating superluminal coordinates [45, 58]. Presently, faster-than-light “sig-\nnalling” can, for instance, be realized by superluminal charge-current pat-\nterns; e.g., by the coordinated motion of aggregates of electrically charged\nparticles [13, 7]. “Signals” of the above type cannot convey useful informa-\ntion and therefore cannot possibly be utilized to violate causality. But it\ncould also be speculated that in the distant future signals of yet unknown\ntype might be discovered which travel faster than light. In this view, the\n“second” type of “light” cone just has not been discovered yet; its discovery\nbeing independent of and beyond the scope of these considerations.\n(iii) Thirdly, the standard debate of conventionality in relativity theory\nwhich concentrates on synchrony can be extended to arbitrary signalling\nspeeds as well. This amounts to a splitting of relativity theory into a section\ndealing with operational meaningful conventions and another section express-\ning the physical content, in particular covariance; i.e., the form invariance of\nthe equations of motion under the resulting space-time transformations.\nIn all these cases the following considerations may yield a clearer under-\nstanding of seemingly “paradoxical” eﬀects such as time travel [25, 46, 41].\nThus it may not appear totally unreasonable to consider generalized system\nrepresentations in which more than one signalling speeds are used to generate\nspace and time scales. The transformation properties of such scales are then\ndeﬁned relative to the signal invoked.\n2 Extending conventionality\nOne of the greatest achievements of Einstein’s theory of relativity is the op-\nerational approach to space and time: Already in Einstein’s original article\n[21], space as well as time scales are generated by physical procedures and\nobservables which are based upon empirical phenomena which and on intrin-\nsically meaningful concepts [15, 63, 59, 60, 51, 52, 61]. Such a requirement\nis by no means trivial. For instance, diﬀerent description levels may use\ndiﬀerent signals (e.g., sound, waves of any form, light, ...).\nThereby, certain conventions have to be assumed, which again have an\noperational meaning by refering to purely physical terms. For instance,\n2standard synchrony at spatially separated locations is conventionalized by\n“radar procedures;” i.e., by sending a signal back and forth between two spa-\ntially separated clocks. The conventionality of synchrony has been discussed,\namong others, by Reichenbach [48], Gr¨ unbaum [31, 30], Winnie [66, 67],\nMalamet [37], Redhead [47] and Sarkar and Stachel [53] (cf. [34] for a re-\nview).\nIn what follows, we shall frequently use Einsteinian clocks based on “radar\ncoordinates.” Thereby, we shall ﬁrst ﬁx an arbitrary unit distance. Radar\ncoordinate clocks use signals going back and forth two reﬂective walls which\nare a predeﬁned unit distance apart. Time is measured by the number of\ntraversals of the signals between the walls. Thus, if diﬀerent signals are used\nto deﬁne time scales, diﬀerent time scales result.\nIn pursuing conventionalism further, it appears not unreasonable to as-\nsume the invariance of the speed of light as merely a convention rather than as\nan empirical ﬁnding. Indeed, the International System of standard units [57]\nhas implemented this approach. Moreover, the light cone structure already\ndecides the transformation of space-time coordinates: Alexandrov’s theorem\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 49, 68, 33, 14, 29] (cf. below; see [12, 36] for a review) states\nthat the (aﬃne) Lorentz transformations are a consequence of the invari-\nance of the speed of light; a reasonable side assumption being the one-to-one\nmapping of coordinates.\nIntroducing relativistic space-time transformations as a consequence of\nconventions rather than of deep physics amounts to introducing relativity\ntheory “upside down,” since in retrospect and in standard reviews [21, 22, 55]\nthe Michelson-Morley and Kennedy-Thorndike experiment is commonly pre-\nsented as an experimental ﬁnding supporting the assumption of the invariance\nof light in all reference frames. Indeed, the very idea that the invariance of the\ntwo-way velocity of light is a mere convention might appear unacceptable.\nYet, within a given level of description, an unavoidable self-referentiality\nshould be acknowledged: all experiments are themselves based upon coor-\ndinates (e.g., clocks and scales) which operate with the very signals whose\ninvariance is experienced.\nIn contradistinction, the relativity principle, stating the form invariance\nof the physical laws under such Lorentz transformations, conveys the non-\ntrivial physical content. In this way, special relativity theory is eﬀectively\nsplit into a section dealing with geometric conventions and a diﬀerent one\ndealing with the representation of physical phenomena.\n3Thereby, general covariance of the physical laws of motion can no longer\nbe required globally. Indeed, form invariance will be satisﬁed only relative\nto a speciﬁc level of description; more precisely: relative to a particular class\nof space-time transformations.\nTo give a simple example: Maxwell’s equation are not form invariant with\nrespect to Lorentz-type transformations generated from the assumption of\nthe invariance of the speed of sound; just as the description of onedimensional\nsound phenomena propagating with velocity ¯ c by f(x−¯ ct)+g(x+¯ ct) is not\ninvariant with respect to the usual Lorentz transformations. Yet, Maxwell’s\nequation are form invariant with respect to the usual Lorentz transforma-\ntions; just as f(x − ¯ ct) + g(x + ¯ ct) is invariant with respect to Lorentz-type\ntransformations generated from the assumption of the invariance of the speed\nof sound ¯ c. [This can be checked by insertion into equation (4).]\nWith respect to a particular level of physical description, the time scale\ngenerated by the corresponding signal may be more appropriate than another\nif we adopt Poincar` e’s criterion [43] resembling Occam’s razor: “Time scales\nshould be deﬁned in such a way that the mechanical equations become as\nsimple as possible. In other words, there is no way to measure time which\nis more correct than another one; the one commonly used is simply the most\nconvenient.”\nThis is a radical departure from the requirement that the fastest signal\nshould be used for coordinatization. Of course, today’s fastest signal, light, is\nperfectly appropriate for today’s fundamental description level of elektromag-\nnetism; the corresponding scales (generated by the assumption of invariance\nof the speed of light) leaving the Maxwell equations and other relativistic\nequations of motion form invariant. But that does by no means imply that\ndiﬀerent signals may not be more appropriate than light for diﬀerent levels\nof physical description.\n3 Lorentz-invariant media\nIf, instead of light, sound waves or water waves would be assumed constant\nin all inertial frames, then very similar “relativistic eﬀects” would result, but\nat a speed lower than the speed of light. This top-down approach to special\nrelativity should be compared to still another bottom-up approach pursued,\namong others, by FitzGerald [65], J´ anossy [35], Toﬀoli [63], Erlichson [23],\n4Bell [8, 10], Mansouri and Sexl [38, 39, 40], Svozil [59, 60], Shupe [56] and\nG¨ unther [32]. There, relativistic forms are derived from “ether”-type theo-\nries.\nSuch considerations might well ﬁt with speculations that the vacuum\nmight be a bifringent medium and that, for some unknown reason (e.g., the\nnonavailability of suitable detectors or the weakness of the signal), only one\nof the two vacuum “light” cones has been observed so far. As we shall mainly\ndeal with the structual concepts of such ﬁndings, we shall not discuss these\nasumptions further.\n4 Transformation laws\nIn what follows we shall consider the transformation properties of coordinates\nbetween diﬀerent reference frames; in particular between frames generated by\ntwo diﬀerent “maximal” signalling speeds. To be more precise, let c denote\nthe velocity of light. Alexandrov’s theorem [1, 2, 3, 4, 49, 68, 33, 14, 29]\n(cf. [12, 36] for a review), states that one-to-one mappings ϕ : R4 → R4\npreserving the Lorentz-Minkowski distance for light signals\n0 = c\n2(tx − ty)\n2 − (x − y)\n2 = c\n2(t\n′\nx − t\n′\ny)\n2 − (x\n′ − y\n′)\n2,\nx = (tx,x),y = (ty,y) ∈ R4 are Lorentz transformations\nx\n′ = ϕ(x) = αLx + a\nup to an aﬃne scale factor α. (A generalization to Rn is straightforward.)\nHence, the Lorentz transformations appear to be essentially derivable from\nthe invariance of the speed of light alone.\nConsider now that we assume the convention that, for one and the same\nphysical system and for reasons not speciﬁed, another arbitrary but diﬀerent\nvelocity ¯ c is invariant, As a result of Alexandrov’s theorem, a diﬀerent set of\nLorentz-type transformation with c substituted by ¯ c is obtained. Of course,\nas can be expected, neither is ¯ c invariant in the usual Lorentz frames, nor\nis c invariant in the Lorentz-type frames containing ¯ c: only the c-light cone\nappears invariant with respect to the transformations containing c; the ¯ c-\nlight cone is not. Conversely, only the ¯ c-light cone appears invariant with\nrespect to the transformations containing ¯ c; the c-light cone is not.\n5Let us, for the sake of the argument, assume that c < ¯ c. For all practical\npurposes, we shall consider two-way velocities (measured back and forth).\nAs argued before, we shall consider two sets of inertial frames Σ, ¯ Σ associ-\nated with c and ¯ c, respectively. The set of all inertial frames Σ is constructed\nby a priori and ad hoc assuming that c is constant. The set of all inertial\nframes ¯ Σ is constructed by a priori and ad hoc assuming that ¯ c is constant.\nThe construction of Σ and ¯ Σ via Alexandrov’s principle is quite standard.\nSince c and ¯ c are deﬁned to be constant, two (aﬃne) Lorentz transformations\nx\n′ = ϕ(x) = αLx + a and (1)\n¯ x\n′ = ¯ ϕ(¯ x) = ¯ α¯ L¯ x + ¯ a (2)\nresult for Σ and ¯ Σ, respectively. (In what follows, the aﬃne factors α, ¯ α are\nset to unity.) We shall also refer to these space and time scales as c-space,\nc-time, and ¯ c-space, ¯ c-time, respectively.\nThe rules for constructing space-time diagrams for the twodimensional\nproblem (time and one space axis) are straightforward as well. The Lorentz\ntransformations (1) and (2) for a = ¯ a = 0 yield\nϕv(x) = (t\n′,x\n′\n1,0,0) = γ\n￿\nt −\nvx1\nc2 ,x1 − vt,0,0\n￿\n, and (3)\n¯ ϕ¯ v(¯ x) = (¯ t\n′, ¯ x1\n′,0,0) = ¯ γ\n￿\n¯ t −\n¯ v ¯ x1\n¯ c2 , ¯ x1 − ¯ v¯ t,0,0\n￿\n, (4)\nwith\nγ = +\n \n1 −\nv2\nc2\n!− 1\n2\nand ¯ γ = +\n \n1 −\n¯ v2\n¯ c2\n!− 1\n2\n.\nFrom now on, we shall write x and ¯ x for x1 and ¯ x1, respectively. The second\nand third spatial coordinate will be omitted.\nConsider faster-than-c velocities v in the range\nc < v ≤ ¯ c.\nFor this velocity range, the Lorentz transformations (3), in particular γ,\nbecome imaginary in the Σ-frames. Therefore, Σ cannot account for such\nvelocities. For ¯ Σ, these velocities are perfectly meaningful, being smaller\nthan or equal to ¯ c.\n6The x′- and t′-axis is obtained by setting t = 0 and x = 0, respectively.\nOne obtains\nt =\nvx\nc2 , and ¯ t =\n¯ v¯ x\n¯ c2 , (5)\nfor the x- and ¯ x-axis, as well as\nt =\nx\nv\n, and ¯ t =\n¯ x\n¯ v\n, (6)\nfor the t- and ¯ t-axis, respectively.\nIn general, c2t2 − x2  = ¯ c2¯ t2 − ¯ x2, except for c = ¯ c and the coordinate\nframes cannot be directly compared. Thus the standard way of identifying\nunities does no longer work.\nWe might, nevertheless, generalize relativity theory by requiring c2t2 −\nx2 = ¯ c2¯ t2 − ¯ x2. In this case, the identiﬁcations for unity are straightforward.\nIn the following, a diﬀerent approach is pursued.\nAnother possibility is to proceed by constructing radar coordinates in the\nfollowing operational way. Let us require that all frames Σ and ¯ Σ have the\nsame origin. That is,\n(t,x) = (0,0) ⇔ (¯ t, ¯ x) = (0,0). (7)\nFurthermore, let us consider the intrinsic coordinatization of two coordinate\nframes σ ∈ Σ and ¯ σ ∈ ¯ Σ which are at rest with respect to each other.\nAs a consequence of the standard Einstein synchronization conventions, two\nevents which occur at the same c-time in σ also occur at the same ¯ c-time in\n¯ σ. Note that this concurrence of syncronicity is true only for the particular\nframes σ and ¯ σ and cannot be expected for all co-moving frames of Σ and\n¯ Σ. At this point, the preference of two frames σ, ¯ σ over others is purely\nconventional and does not reﬂect any “deep physics.”\nLet us ﬁrst assume that we proceed by ﬁxing one and the same unit of\ndistance for both coordinate systems; i.e., x = ¯ x. In such a case, the radar\ntime coordinate ¯ t can be expressed in terms of the radar time coordinate t by\n¯ t = (¯ c/c)t. This is illustrated in Figure 1. In c-time 1, the faster signal with\nvelocity ¯ c has been relayed back and forth the reﬂecting walls by a factor\n¯ c/c. Thus in summary, the transformation laws between σ and ¯ σ are\n(¯ t(t,x), ¯ x(t,x)) = (\n¯ c\nc\nt,x).

The vertical lines rep-\nresent mirrors for both signals at velocities c (denoted by a dashed line\n“− − −”), and ¯ c (denoted by “−   −   −”).\n8A more general conversion between Σ and ¯ Σ involving moving coordinates\nis obtained by applying successively the inverse Lorentz transformation (3)\nand the Lorentz transformation (4) with velocities v and ¯ w, respectively; i.e.,\n(¯ x\n′′,¯ t\n′′) = ¯ ϕ ¯ w(¯ t\n′, ¯ x\n′) = ¯ ϕ ¯ w(\n¯ c\nc\nt\n′,x\n′), (9)\nwith\n(t\n′,x\n′) = ϕv\n−1(t,x).

As can be expected, for c = ¯ c and v = ¯ w, equa-\ntion (11) reduces to (¯ t′′(t,x), ¯ x′′(t,x)) = (t,x).\nInstead of identical space coordinates for two frames at rest with respect\nto each other, we could have chosen invariant time coordinates in both frames.\nA dual construction yields the transformation laws\n(¯ t(t,x), ¯ x(t,x)) = (t,\nc\n¯ c\nx). (12)\nLet us now consider space-time diagrams for Σ and ¯ Σ. Figure 2 depicts\ntwodimensional coordinate frames generated for ¯ Σ. The shaded region with\nthe slope within [c, 1\nc] are not allowed for Σ. They correspond to faster-than-c\nframes.\nFigure 3 draws a reprentation of the sets of frames Σ and ¯ Σ in the set of\nall aﬃne frames, denoted by a square.\n5 Quasi time paradoxa and their resolution\nSince ¯ c > c, superluminal signalling by any velocity v with ¯ c ≥ v > c with\nrespect to c is an option for Σ. This could, at least from a straightforward\npoint of view, result in quasi-time paradoxes, such as Tolman’s [64, 11, 45,\n46] or G¨ odel’s paradoxes [25, 26, 27]. They originate from the fact that,\ngiven superluminal signalling, signalling back in c-time is conceivable, making\na diagonalization argument [17, 18, 50, 42] similar to the classical liar [5]\n96\n- ￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿ ￿ ￿\n￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿ ￿ *\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿\n￿ ￿\n¯ x\n1\nc\n¯ c\nc\n¯ t\np\np\np\np\nFigure 2: Inertial frames of ¯ Σ.

The intersection between Σ and ¯ Σ represents frames of equal syn-\nchrony.\n10possible [62]. Stated pointedly: given free will, this would enable an agent\nto send a signal backwards in time if and only if the agent has not received\nthis message before. Or, in a more violent version, kill the agent’s own\ngrandfather in early childhood [41]. Likewise, this would allow an agent\nto become very knowledgeable, powerful and rich, which is not necessarily\nparadoxical.\nTo illustrate the quasi-paradoxical nature of the argument, let us con-\nsider a concrete example. Assume as the two signalling speeds c and ¯ c the\nspeed of sound and the speed of light, respectively. Let us further assume\nthat there exist intelligent beings — let us call them “soundlanders” — ca-\npable of developing physics in their “ether”-medium [56, 59, 60, 20, 32]. For\nthem, sound would appear as a perfectly appropriate phenomenon to base\ntheir coordinate frames upon. What if they discover sonoluminiscence; i.e.,\ncreation of signals at supersonar speeds ¯ c? Surely, because of the conceivable\nparadoxes discussed before, this would result in a denial of the experimental\nﬁndings at ﬁrst and in a crisis of (theoretical sound) physics later. Fig. 4 de-\npicts the construction of a quasi-time paradox, as perceived from the inertial\nframe Σ generated by sound and the inertial frame ¯ Σ generated by light.\nAs can be expected, when viewed from ¯ Σ, the seemingly “paradoxical”\nprocess perceived by Σ is not paradoxical at all. It appears that one res-\nolution of the paradoxes is to switch the level of observation and take the\nperspective that the “true physics” is not based upon sound but on electro-\nmagnetic phenomena. After all, sound waves result from the coordinated\nmotion of aggregates of atoms or molecules, which in turn is dominated by\nthe electromagnetic forces. In this extrinsic view, the “sound physics” of\nthe “soundlanders” is a representation of the phenomena at an intermediate\nlevel of description [6, 54]. Since from that viewpoint, the appropriate sig-\nnalling speed is electromagnetic radiation at velocity ¯ c, paradoxes disappear.\nThus any attempt to construct paradoxes at the intermediate level of sound\nsignals is doomed to fail because that level of description turns out to be\ninappropriate for the particular purpose.\nThis extrinsic viewpoint is juxtaposed by the intrinsic viewpoint [15, 63,\n59, 60, 51, 52, 61] of the “soundlanders” pretending to maintain their in-\ntermediate level of “sound physics.” For them, paradoxes are not realizable\nbecause certain procedures or actions are not operational. This amounts to\nthe resolution of time paradoxes by the principle of self-consistency [24] as\nalready discussed, for instance, in Nahin’s monograph [41, p. 272].\n11a)\n6\n- ￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\nx\nc\nt\n¯ c\np\nA B\nC\n1\n￿\np p p\npp\nx′\nt′\nb)\n6\n- ￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\nx′\nc\nt′\n¯ c\np\nC\nB\nA\np\np\np\np\np\nc)\n6\n- ￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\n￿ ￿\n¯ x\n¯ c\n¯ t\np\np\np\np\n￿\n:\n￿ ￿\np\np\nA\nB\nC\n¯ t′\n¯ x′\nc\nFigure 4: a) Quasi-time paradox as perceived from Σ-frame (t,x).

Even if exotic scenarios such as a birefringent vacuum\nappears highly unlikely, some lessons for the presentation and interpretation\nof standard relativity theory, in particular the splitting of conventions from\nthe form invariance of the physical laws, can be learned.\nTheory — in the author’s opinion for the worse — tends to exert a con-\nservative inﬂuence in declining that faster-than-light or “superluminal” infor-\nmation communication and travel of the type “breakfast on Earth, lunch on\nAlpha Centauri, and home for dinner with your wife and children, not your\ngreat-great-great grandchildren” [44] is conceivable. Accordingly, any exper-\nimental, empirical claim of allegedly superluminal phenomena is confronted\nwith the strongest resistance from the theoretical orthodoxy, pretending on\nthe principal impossibility for superluminal communication.\nThe author is not convinced that as of today there is reason to believe\nthat there is experimental evidence of faster-than-light communication via\ntunnelling or other phenomena. Yet, one cannot know when, if ever, su-\nperluminal phenomena may be discovered. (In the author’s opinion these\nwould most probably show up in an allegedly nonpreservation of energy and\nmomentum; very much in the same way as sonoluminiscence may be viewed\nfrom the description level of sound.) Hence, one purpose of this study has\nbeen the attempt to free experiment from the pressure of the theoretical or-\nthodoxy. “Superluminal” signalling per se is accountable for and does not\nnecessarily imply “phenomenologic” inconsistency.\nFrom a system theoretic point of view, a generalized principle of overall\nconsistency of the phenomena might be used to demontrate that too powerful\nagents would become inconsistent. As a consequence, the predictive power\nas well as the physical operationalizability (command over the phenomena)\nis limited by this consistency requirement. Events which may appear un-\ndecidable and uncontrollable to an intrinsic observer bound by incomplete\nknowledge may be perfectly controllable and decidable with respect to a\nmore complete theory. In such a framework, diﬀerent signalling speeds, in\nparticular also superluminal signalling, can well be accommodated within a\ngeneralized theory of relativity. They do not necessarily mean inconsisten-\ncies but just refer to diﬀerent levels of physical descriptions and conventions\nwhich have to be careful accounted for.\n13Acknowledgements\nThe author is grateful for discussions with and suggestions and comments\nby John Casti, Georg Franck, G¨ unther Krenn, Johann Summhammer, Otto\nR¨ ossler, Franz-G¨ unter Winkler and Helmuth Urbantke.
